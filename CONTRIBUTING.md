## Our Philosophy

This database operates on these principles:

1. **Accuracy over completeness** - We'd rather have fewer strategies documented correctly than more strategies with errors
2. **Humility about limitations** - No resource can cover every situation; we acknowledge what we don't cover
3. **Community improvement** - Errors will happen; we fix them transparently and thank those who report them
4. **Professional standards** - Content should meet the standard a CPA would expect from a peer

## Style Guidelines

### Writing Style

- **Be precise** - Use specific numbers, thresholds, and dates
- **Be practical** - Focus on implementation, not just theory
- **Be current** - Reference the most recent law (OBBBA 2025 where applicable)
- **Be professional** - Write for an audience of tax professionals

### Formatting Rules

1. **Headings**: Use H2 (`##`) for main sections, H3 (`###`) for subsections
2. **Lists**: Use bullet points for items, numbered lists for sequential steps
3. **Tables**: Use markdown tables for thresholds, comparisons, and calculations
4. **Bold**: Use for key terms, amounts, and emphasis
5. **Links**: Use relative links for internal references (`[Strategy](strategy.md)`)

### Numbers and Amounts

- Use **$X,XXX** format with commas for dollar amounts
- Express percentages as **X%** (e.g., 23%, not .23 or 23 percent)
- Include tax year when thresholds are year-specific
- Round to reasonable precision (don't show $123,456.78 when $123,500 suffices for illustration)

### Tax Law References

Always cite primary sources:

| Source Type | Format Example |
|-------------|----------------|
| IRC Section | IRC Section 199A |
| Treasury Regulation | Treas. Reg. 1.199A-1 |
| Revenue Ruling | Rev. Rul. 2023-XX |
| Revenue Procedure | Rev. Proc. 2023-XX |
| IRS Notice | Notice 2023-XX |
| Court Case | *Smith v. Commissioner*, T.C. Memo 2023-XX |

## Accuracy Standards

### Avoiding Overclaiming

**Do not use language that overclaims the scope or authority of this resource:**

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "The definitive guide" | "A comprehensive resource" |
| "Everything you need to know" | "Key topics including..." |
| "The most comprehensive" | "A detailed resource" |
| "Every detail" | "Important considerations" |
| "Always" (without qualification) | "Generally" or "In most cases" |
| "Never" (without qualification) | "Rarely" or "In most cases, avoid" |

### Acknowledging Limitations

When writing strategy documents:

1. **Note exceptions** - If a rule has exceptions, mention them (even if you don't detail all of them)
2. **Acknowledge complexity** - If a topic has nuances beyond the scope of the document, say so
3. **Reference professionals** - Remind readers to consult qualified professionals for their specific situation
4. **State jurisdictional limits** - Note when guidance applies only to federal tax or specific states

### Citing Authoritative Sources

Every strategy document should cite primary sources:

- **Internal Revenue Code (IRC)** - The actual law (e.g., IRC Section 199A)
- **Treasury Regulations** - IRS interpretive rules (e.g., Treas. Reg. 1.199A-1)
- **IRS Guidance** - Revenue Rulings, Revenue Procedures, Notices, Announcements
- **Court Cases** - Tax Court, Circuit Courts, Supreme Court decisions

**Where to find authoritative sources:**
- IRC: [uscode.house.gov](https://uscode.house.gov/browse/prelim@title26)
- Treasury Regulations: [ecfr.gov](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-26)
- IRS Guidance: [irs.gov](https://www.irs.gov/)
- Tax Court: [ustaxcourt.gov](https://www.ustaxcourt.gov/)

### Handling Uncertainty

When tax treatment is unclear or debated:

1. **State the uncertainty** - "The IRS has not issued definitive guidance on..."
2. **Present multiple views** - "Some practitioners argue X, while others take position Y"
3. **Note the risk** - "Taking this position may increase audit risk"
4. **Recommend professional guidance** - "Consult with a tax attorney before..."
