# Intentionally Defective Grantor Trusts (IDGTs)

## Overview

An Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust (IDGT) is an irrevocable trust that is purposely designed to be treated as a "grantor trust" for income tax purposes while being excluded from the grantor's estate for estate tax purposes. This dual characterization creates powerful planning opportunities, particularly when combined with an installment sale of appreciating assets to the trust.

## Key Benefits

- Transfer appreciating assets outside of taxable estate
- No income tax on sale of assets to the trust
- Grantor pays income tax on trust earnings (further reducing estate)
- Growth above note interest rate passes tax-free
- Frozen estate value at time of transfer
- Leverage the difference between estate and income tax treatment
- Use in combination with valuation discounts (FLP/LLC interests)

## How IDGTs Work

### The "Defect"

The trust is "defective" for income tax purposes because it includes provisions that trigger grantor trust status under IRC Sections 671-679, such as:
- Power to substitute assets of equivalent value
- Borrowing from trust without adequate security
- Certain administrative powers
- Adverse party requirements

### Dual Tax Treatment

| Tax Type | Treatment | Result |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Income Tax | Grantor Trust | Grantor pays all income tax |
| Gift Tax | Completed Gift | Uses exemption (for seed gift) |
| Estate Tax | Excluded | Assets not in grantor's estate |

### Basic Structure

```
┌─────────────┐     Seed Gift      ┌─────────────────┐
│   Grantor   │ ─────────────────► │      IDGT       │
└─────────────┘    (10% of value)  └─────────────────┘
       │                                   │

```

## Installment Sale to IDGT

### Why This Works

1. **No Gain Recognition**: Sale between grantor and grantor trust is ignored for income tax
2. **Interest Rate**: AFR (often lower than expected returns)
3. **Growth Arbitrage**: Any growth above AFR passes tax-free to trust
4. **Estate Freeze**: Asset value frozen at sale price
5. **Income Tax Paid by Grantor**: Further depletes estate

### Applicable Federal Rates (AFR) - Sample

| Term | AFR (Approximate) |
|------|-------------------|
| Short-term (≤3 years) | 4.5% |
| Mid-term (3-9 years) | 4.2% |
| Long-term (>9 years) | 4.4% |

*Rates change monthly*

### Sale Structure Example

**Setup:**
- Asset value: $10,000,000
- Seed gift to IDGT: $1,000,000 (10% cushion)
- Sale price: $9,000,000
- Note term: 9 years (balloon)
- Interest rate: 4.2% (mid-term AFR)

**Economics:**

| Year | Beginning Balance | Interest (4.2%) | Payment | Ending Balance |
|------|------------------:|----------------:|--------:|---------------:|
| 1 | $9,000,000 | $378,000 | ($378,000) | $9,000,000 |
| 2-8 | $9,000,000 | $378,000 | ($378,000) | $9,000,000 |
| 9 | $9,000,000 | $378,000 | ($9,378,000) | $0 |

**If asset grows at 8% annually:**

| Year | Asset Value | Note Balance | Net to Trust |
|------|------------:|-------------:|-------------:|
| 0 | $10,000,000 | $9,000,000 | $1,000,000 |
| 9 | $19,990,046 | $0 | $19,990,046 |

**Wealth Transfer:**
- Initial seed gift: $1,000,000
- Growth transferred: $18,990,046
- Total to beneficiaries: $19,990,046
- Gift tax used: $1,000,000
- Estate tax on transfer: $0

## Requirements

### Trust Requirements
- Valid irrevocable trust under state law
- Defective for income tax (grantor trust provisions)
- NOT defective for estate tax (no estate inclusion triggers)
- Independent trustee recommended
- Proper trust administration

### Grantor Trust Triggers (Use One or More)
- **Section 675(4)(C)**: Power to substitute assets of equivalent value
- **Section 677**: Trust income may be used to pay premiums on grantor's life insurance
- **Section 674**: Nonadverse party controls beneficial enjoyment
- **Section 675(2)**: Power to borrow without adequate security

### Installment Sale Requirements
- Bona fide sale at fair market value
- Arm's length terms
- Adequate interest rate (at least AFR)
- Note must be legitimate debt obligation
- Trust must have ability to repay (seed gift cushion)

### Seed Gift Requirements
- Generally 10% of sale price
- Creates equity cushion in trust
- Demonstrates trust's independent economic substance
- Can be lower with strong assets, higher with risky assets

## Client Fit Criteria

### Ideal Candidates
- High-net-worth individuals with appreciating assets
- Those with assets expected to grow faster than AFR
- Business owners anticipating liquidity events
- Individuals with remaining gift tax exemption
- Those wanting to freeze estate value
- Owners of discountable assets (FLP/LLC interests)
- Real estate investors

### Ideal Assets for IDGT Sales
- FLP/LLC interests (discounted values)
- Closely-held business stock
- Real estate expected to appreciate
- Pre-IPO company stock
- Growth securities
- Income-producing assets (to service note)

### Less Ideal Candidates
- Those with limited gift tax exemption remaining
- Assets unlikely to outperform AFR
- Individuals needing cash flow from assets
- Short-term planning horizons
- Taxpayers in poor health

   - Ensure ability to service note
   - Consider refinancing opportunities

## Advanced Strategies

### IDGT + FLP/LLC Combination

**Powerful Layering:**
1. Transfer assets to FLP
2. Gift 10% LP interests to IDGT (with discounts)
3. Sell 90% LP interests to IDGT (with discounts)

**Discount Enhancement:**
- $10M property in FLP
- LP interest discount: 35%
- 90% LP interest FMV: $5,850,000 (not $9M)
- Note amount: $5,850,000
- Interest required: Much lower

### GRAT + IDGT Combination

**Strategy:**
1. Fund GRAT with appreciating asset
2. GRAT remainder pours into IDGT
3. Sell additional assets to IDGT
4. Maximize leverage of both techniques

### Substitution Power Usage

**Asset Swap Strategy:**
- Grantor substitutes low-basis assets into trust
- Grantor receives high-basis assets back
- Trust holds low-basis assets
- At grantor's death, heirs get stepped-up basis on received assets
- Trust assets retain low basis (but excluded from estate)

### Defined Value Clause

**Protection Mechanism:**
- Sale defined as assets equal to specific value
- If IRS revalues, only defined value transferred
- Excess returns to grantor
- *Wandry* and *Petter* cases support validity
- Include in all IDGT sale structures

## Risks & Considerations

### Note Exhaustion Risk
- If assets decline, trust may not repay note
- Note balance returns to estate at death
- Seed gift cushion helps but doesn't eliminate
- Consider life insurance backup

### Interest Rate Risk
- Higher AFRs increase hurdle rate
- Monitor rates when planning
- Lock in favorable rates
- Consider timing of sale

### Valuation Risk
- IRS may challenge asset valuations
- Adequate appraisals essential
- Defined value clauses help
- Gift tax statute of limitations applies

### Grantor Trust Termination Risk
- If trust loses grantor trust status, gain recognized
- Ensure trigger provisions maintained
- Monitor for inadvertent termination
- Consider backup provisions

### Legislative Risk
- Proposals to tax IDGT sales as gifts
- Proposals to limit grantor trust benefits
- Grandfather existing transactions
- Consider accelerating planning

### Note Default Risk
- Must ensure trust can service note
- Seed gift provides cushion
- Income from assets should cover interest
- Consider note modification if needed
