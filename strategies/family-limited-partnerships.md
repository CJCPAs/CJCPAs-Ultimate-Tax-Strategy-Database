# Family Limited Partnerships (FLPs) and Family LLCs

## Overview

Family Limited Partnerships (FLPs) and Family Limited Liability Companies (Family LLCs) are entity structures that allow families to consolidate assets, facilitate wealth transfer at discounted values, maintain control over assets, and provide asset protection. These entities are cornerstone strategies for sophisticated estate planning, enabling significant transfer tax savings through valuation discounts.

## Key Benefits

- Transfer wealth at discounted values (20-40% discounts typical)
- Maintain control while transferring economic interest
- Centralized asset management across generations
- Asset protection from creditors and divorcing spouses
- Facilitate family governance and succession planning
- Income splitting among family members
- Avoid probate on transferred interests

### Family LLC Structure

| Role | Description | Typical Ownership |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Managing Member | Control and management | Parents (1-10%) |
| Non-Managing Members | Economic rights only | Children/Trusts (90-99%) |

### Key Distinctions

| Feature | FLP | Family LLC |
|---------|-----|------------|
| Liability | GP has unlimited liability | All members have limited liability |
| State law | Uniform Partnership Act | State LLC acts vary |
| Charging order | Strong in most states | Varies by state |
| Flexibility | Less flexible | More flexible |
| Formalities | Partnership agreement | Operating agreement |

## Valuation Discounts

### Types of Discounts

**Lack of Control (Minority) Discount**
- Limited partners cannot force distributions
- Cannot participate in management
- Cannot sell partnership assets
- Typical discount: 15-25%

**Lack of Marketability Discount**
- No public market for interests
- Transfer restrictions
- Limited buyer pool
- Typical discount: 20-35%

**Combined Discount**
- Discounts are applied multiplicatively
- Example: (1 - 0.20) × (1 - 0.30) = 0.56
- Total discount: 44%

### Discount Application Example

| Item | Value |
|------|------:|
| FLP assets (real estate) | $10,000,000 |
| 30% limited partnership interest | $3,000,000 (pro rata) |
| Lack of control discount (20%) | ($600,000) |
| Adjusted value | $2,400,000 |
| Lack of marketability discount (30%) | ($720,000) |
| **Fair market value of interest** | **$1,680,000** |
| **Effective discount** | **44%** |

## Risks & Considerations

### IRS Challenge Risks

**IRC Section 2036 - Retained Interest**
- If transferor retains right to income or control, full value included in estate
- Bona fide sale exception requires:
  - Legitimate business purpose
  - Full and adequate consideration
- *Estate of Powell*, *Estate of Strangi* demonstrate risks

**IRC Section 2703 - Buy-Sell Agreements**
- Restrictions ignored unless:
  - Bona fide business arrangement
  - Not device to transfer for less than FMV
  - Comparable to arm's length terms

**IRC Section 2704 - Lapsing Rights**
- Applicable restrictions may be disregarded
- Liquidation restrictions potentially ignored
- Proposed regulations (withdrawn) would have been more restrictive

### Common IRS Attack Points
- Deathbed formations
- Lack of business purpose
- Failure to maintain formalities
- Retained control/enjoyment
- Commingling of assets
- Disproportionate distributions
- Personal use of assets

### Best Practices to Avoid IRS Challenge
1. Form entity well before death/disability
2. Document legitimate business purposes
3. Maintain strict formalities
4. Never commingle assets
5. Avoid personal use of FLP assets
6. Make pro rata distributions
7. Retain competent appraisers
8. File complete gift tax returns

### Asset Protection Risks
- Fraudulent transfer rules
- Must form before creditor issues arise
- Some states have weak charging order protection
- Insider transfers scrutinized

## Case Study

### Scenario
William and Martha, both age 68, own $25 million in assets including:
- Investment real estate: $15 million
- Marketable securities: $8 million
- Primary residence: $2 million

They want to transfer wealth to their four children while maintaining control and minimizing estate taxes.

### FLP Strategy

**Structure:**
- Form ABC Family Partners, LP
- William and Martha's LLC as 1% General Partner
- William and Martha as 49% Limited Partners initially
- Gift limited partnership interests over time

**Assets Contributed:**
- Investment real estate: $15 million
- Securities: $5 million
- Total: $20 million

**Interest Allocation:**
- GP (W&M's LLC): 1%
- LP (William): 49.5%
- LP (Martha): 49.5%

### Gifting Program

**Valuation Analysis:**
- 10% LP interest pro rata value: $2,000,000
- Combined discount (40%): ($800,000)
- Discounted value: $1,200,000

**Annual Gifting (Using Exemption):**

| Year | Interest Gifted | Pro Rata Value | Discounted Value | Gift Tax |
|------|---------------:|---------------:|----------------:|----------|
| 2024 | 20% | $4,000,000 | $2,400,000 | $0 (exemption) |
| 2025 | 20% | $4,000,000 | $2,400,000 | $0 (exemption) |
| 2026 | 10% | $2,000,000 | $1,200,000 | $0 (exemption) |

**Total Transferred (3 years):**
- 50% limited partnership interest
- Pro rata value: $10,000,000
- Gift tax value: $6,000,000
- Exemption used: $6,000,000
- Gift tax paid: $0

### Results

| Without FLP | With FLP |
|------------:|----------:|
| Estate: $25M | Estate: $15M + 50% FLP |
| Taxable: $25M - $27.22M exemption = $0 | (Assets removed from estate) |
| *If exemption drops to $14M in 2026:* | |
| Taxable: $25M - $14M = $11M | Taxable: $15M - $14M = $1M |
| Estate tax: $4.4M | Estate tax: $400,000 |
| **Savings with FLP:** | **$4,000,000** |

### Additional Benefits
- Control retained through GP interest
- Asset protection for children
- Centralized management
- Future appreciation excluded from estate
- Training ground for next generation
