# Medicare IRMAA Planning

## Overview

Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA) is a surcharge added to Medicare Part B and Part D premiums for higher-income beneficiaries. IRMAA is based on Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) from two years prior, creating planning opportunities to manage income and reduce or avoid these significant additional costs. For high-income retirees, IRMAA can add $10,000+ annually to healthcare costs.

*Annual extra cost per person, double for married couple

### MAGI for IRMAA Purposes

**MAGI = AGI + Tax-Exempt Interest Income**

Includes:
- Wages, salaries, tips
- Taxable interest and dividends
- Capital gains
- IRA and pension distributions
- Rental income
- Business income
- Social Security (taxable portion)
- Tax-exempt bond interest (added back)

Does NOT include:
- HSA contributions (reduces AGI)
- Non-taxable Social Security
- Qualified charitable distributions (QCDs)
- Step-up in basis at death

## IRMAA Impact Analysis

### Annual Cost Comparison (2024, MFJ)

| MAGI | Part B (×2) | Part D (×2) | Total Annual |
|------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| $206,000 | $4,193 | $0 | $4,193 |
| $210,000 | $5,870 | $310 | $6,180 |
| $260,000 | $8,386 | $799 | $9,185 |
| $330,000 | $10,901 | $1,291 | $12,192 |
| $400,000 | $13,416 | $1,781 | $15,197 |

**Marginal Impact**: Just $1 over threshold can cost $1,987+ annually (first tier)

### The "IRMAA Cliff"

**Critical planning concept:**

At $206,001 MAGI (MFJ):
- Premium increase: $69.90/month/person
- Annual cost for couple: $1,677

**Effective marginal rate** on that extra $1 of income: 167,700%

## Requirements

### Who Pays IRMAA?
- Medicare Part B enrollees
- Medicare Part D enrollees
- Based on most recent tax return available to SSA
- Typically 2-year look-back

### IRMAA Determination Process
1. IRS shares tax data with SSA
2. SSA determines IRMAA tier
3. Notice sent (IRMAA Determination Notice)
4. Premium adjusted automatically
5. Can appeal within 60 days

### Life-Changing Event Exceptions

**Can request reconsideration for:**
- Marriage/divorce/annulment
- Death of spouse
- Work stoppage (retirement)
- Work reduction
- Loss of income-producing property
- Loss of pension income
- Employer settlement payment

**Form:** SSA-44 (Medicare Part B Income-Related Premium - Life-Changing Event)

## Client Fit Criteria

### Who Needs IRMAA Planning?

| Situation | Planning Priority |
|-----------|-------------------|
| MAGI near any threshold | High |
| Large one-time income expected | High |
| Planning Roth conversions | High |
| Selling business/property | High |
| Entering Medicare | High |
| Taking RMDs | Moderate |
| Already in highest tier | Lower |

### Key Planning Windows

**2 Years Before Medicare:**
- Actions now affect IRMAA at 65
- Accelerate income before this period
- Or defer income past this period

**2 Years Before Retirement:**
- Final working years affect early Medicare
- Plan income carefully

## Planning Strategies

### Strategy 1: Income Bunching

**Concept:** Concentrate income in fewer years, stay below threshold in others

**Example:**
Instead of:
| Year | MAGI | IRMAA (MFJ) |
|------|------|-------------|
| 2024 | $230,000 | $1,677/year |
| 2025 | $230,000 | $1,677/year |
| 2026 | $230,000 | $1,677/year |
| Total IRMAA | | $5,031 |

Do this:
| Year | MAGI | IRMAA (MFJ) |
|------|------|-------------|
| 2024 | $340,000 | $7,980/year |
| 2025 | $175,000 | $0 |
| 2026 | $175,000 | $0 |
| Total IRMAA | | $7,980 |

**Net: Still pay $2,949 less in IRMAA**

*Combine with one high-income year for large Roth conversions, capital gains, etc.*

### Strategy 2: Roth Conversion Timing

**Roth conversions increase MAGI and can trigger IRMAA**

**Pre-Medicare Strategy:**
- Aggressive Roth conversions before age 63
- Impacts IRMAA at 65, but may be worth it
- Build Roth assets that don't affect future IRMAA

**Post-Medicare Strategy:**
- Convert up to IRMAA threshold
- Avoid "next tier" conversions
- Spread conversions across years

**Example:**
| Approach | Roth Conversion | MAGI | IRMAA |
|----------|-----------------|------|-------|
| Aggressive | $200,000 | $350,000 | $7,980 |
| Optimized | $56,000 | $206,000 | $0 |
| Savings | | | $7,980/year |

### Strategy 3: Capital Gains Timing

**Long-term gains included in MAGI**

**Planning Opportunities:**
- Harvest gains in years already in highest IRMAA tier
- Defer gains in years near threshold
- Use loss harvesting to reduce MAGI
- Installment sales to spread gains

### Strategy 4: Charitable Giving Optimization

**Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs):**
- Must be 70½ or older
- Direct transfer from IRA to charity
- Up to $105,000/year (2024)
- Excludes amount from AGI
- Reduces MAGI for IRMAA

**Example:**
| Without QCD | With QCD |
|-------------|----------|
| RMD: $75,000 | QCD: $50,000 |
| MAGI: $275,000 | RMD remaining: $25,000 |
| IRMAA tier: Third | MAGI: $225,000 |
| Premium: $349.40 | IRMAA tier: First |
| | Premium: $244.60 |
| | Savings: $1,257/year |

### Strategy 5: Asset Location Optimization

**Tax-inefficient assets in tax-advantaged accounts:**
- Bonds and REITs in traditional IRA
- Growth stocks in taxable (lower distributions)
- Reduces current MAGI from investment income

**Municipal Bonds Consideration:**
- Tax-exempt interest IS added to MAGI for IRMAA
- May not be best choice for Medicare beneficiaries
- Consider total return approach instead

### Strategy 6: Life-Changing Event Appeal

**Use when appropriate:**

| Event | Documentation Needed |
|-------|---------------------|
| Retirement | Letter from employer, pension start date |
| Work reduction | Pay stubs showing reduced income |
| Spouse death | Death certificate, income change proof |
| Divorce | Divorce decree, income change proof |
| Property loss | Insurance claim, settlement documents |

**Process:**
1. Complete Form SSA-44
2. Provide documentation
3. Submit to local SSA office
4. SSA reviews and adjusts if approved
5. Can use current year or prior year income

### Strategy 7: Medicare Enrollment Timing

**Delaying Part B enrollment:**
- If working and have employer coverage
- Delay Medicare Part B
- Avoid IRMAA during high-income working years
- Enroll when retired/lower income

**Caution:**
- Must have creditable employer coverage
- Late enrollment penalties if no creditable coverage
- Evaluate carefully

## Integration with Other Strategies

### IRMAA + Social Security Coordination

| SS Claiming Age | Impact on IRMAA |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Claim at 62 | SS income affects MAGI earlier |
| Delay to 70 | Lower MAGI during delay years |
| | Higher MAGI after 70 |

**Strategy:** Delay SS, do Roth conversions, manage IRMAA

### IRMAA + RMD Planning

**RMDs increase MAGI starting at 73**

| Approach | Strategy |
|----------|----------|
| Before 73 | Convert to Roth to reduce future RMDs |
| At 73+ | QCDs to offset RMD income |
| | Consider asset location changes |

### IRMAA + Business Exit

**Large business sale income:**
- Plan timing relative to Medicare eligibility
- Consider installment sale to spread income
- May trigger maximum IRMAA for 2 years
- Life-changing event appeal may help

## Risks & Considerations

### Planning Limitations
- 2-year look-back limits real-time adjustments
- Tax law changes can affect thresholds
- Life events unpredictable
- Threshold adjustments may not keep pace with inflation

### Unintended Consequences
- Focusing only on IRMAA may hurt overall tax efficiency
- Higher tier one year may be better than threshold every year
- Consider total cost, not just Medicare premiums

### State Health Insurance Implications
- IRMAA only affects Medicare
- State programs may have different rules
- Medigap premiums not affected by income

## Case Study

### Scenario
Richard and Barbara, both 65, are retiring:
- Total retirement income: $280,000
- Includes: Pension $100,000, Traditional IRA RMD $80,000, SS $50,000, Investment income $50,000
- Current MAGI: $280,000
- IRMAA: $4,989/year (each) = $9,978/year for couple

### Optimization Strategy

**Step 1: QCD from IRA**
- Barbara does $50,000 QCD
- Reduces MAGI by $50,000
- New MAGI: $230,000

**Step 2: Donor Advised Fund Bunching**
- Make 3 years of charitable contributions in one year
- $30,000 to DAF (funds future giving)
- Reduces MAGI to $200,000

### Results

| Metric | Before | After | Savings |
|--------|--------|-------|---------|
| MAGI | $280,000 | $200,000 | $80,000 |
| IRMAA tier | Third | None | |
| Annual IRMAA | $9,978 | $0 | $9,978 |
| Charitable giving | Same | Same | |
| Tax deduction | Lower | Higher | ~$6,000 |
| **Net annual benefit** | | | **~$16,000** |

### Long-Term Impact
- 10 years of IRMAA savings: $99,780
- Plus tax savings from charitable bunching
- Plus continued QCD strategy benefits
- Total benefit: $150,000+ over retirement
