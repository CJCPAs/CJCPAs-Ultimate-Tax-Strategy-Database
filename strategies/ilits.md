# Irrevocable Life Insurance Trusts (ILITs)

## Overview

An Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT) is a trust designed to own life insurance policies outside of the insured's estate. When properly structured, the death benefit passes to beneficiaries completely free of estate tax, income tax, and generation-skipping transfer tax. ILITs are one of the most effective tools for creating tax-free wealth for future generations.

## Key Benefits

- Death benefit excluded from insured's taxable estate
- Proceeds pass income-tax-free to beneficiaries
- Can provide estate liquidity without increasing taxable estate
- Leverage annual exclusion gifts to fund premiums
- Protection from creditors in most states
- Control over distribution of proceeds
- Can benefit multiple generations (dynasty ILIT)

## Crummey Powers Detailed

### What Are Crummey Powers?
Named after the Crummey v. Commissioner case, these are withdrawal rights that convert future interest gifts (insurance policy) into present interest gifts (qualifying for annual exclusion).

### How They Work

**Timeline:**
```
Day 1: Grantor contributes $18,000 to ILIT
Day 1-3: Trustee sends Crummey notices
Day 4-34: 30-day withdrawal window
Day 35: Withdrawal right lapses
Day 35+: Trustee pays insurance premium
```

### Crummey Notice Requirements
- Written notice to each beneficiary
- Describe contribution amount
- Explain withdrawal right
- Specify withdrawal deadline
- Keep copies with trust records

### Sample Notice Language
> "You are hereby notified that a contribution of $______ has been made to the [Trust Name]. You have the right to withdraw up to $______ from the trust within 30 days of receipt of this notice. If you do not exercise this right, it will lapse."

### Hanging Crummey Powers
- Address lapse in excess of 5%/$5,000 limit
- Excess lapse could be gift from beneficiary
- Hanging power: withdrawal right doesn't fully lapse
- Carries over to future years
- Complex—requires careful drafting

## Types of ILITs

### Standard ILIT
- Single insured
- Fixed beneficiaries
- Terminates at distribution

### Survivorship (Second-to-Die) ILIT
- Insures both spouses
- Pays at second death
- Lower premiums
- Ideal for estate tax planning

### Dynasty ILIT
- Multi-generational
- Uses GST exemption
- Perpetual or long-term
- See [Dynasty Trusts](dynasty-trusts.md)

### Spousal Access ILIT
- Includes spouse as discretionary beneficiary
- Some indirect access to funds
- Reduced asset protection
- Estate inclusion risk if not careful

### Premium-Financed ILIT
- Loans fund initial premiums
- Policy cash value secures loan
- Complex structure
- Higher risk/reward

## Risks & Considerations

### Estate Inclusion Risks
- **Incidents of ownership**: Any retained control causes inclusion
- **Three-year rule**: Transferred policies within 3 years included
- **Trustee issues**: Grantor as trustee causes inclusion
- **Payment of premiums**: Direct payment may cause issues

### Gift Tax Risks
- Contributions exceeding annual exclusions use lifetime exemption
- Crummey notices must be properly administered
- Multiple beneficiaries needed for large premiums
- Gift tax return required for split gifts

### Administrative Risks
- Failure to send Crummey notices
- Inadequate documentation
- Missed premium payments
- Improper trustee selection

### Policy Risks
- Underperformance of cash value
- Carrier insolvency
- Premium increases (universal life)
- Lapse from underfunding

### Flexibility Risks
- Irrevocable—cannot undo
- Cannot change terms easily
- Beneficiary changes limited
- Trustee removal may be restricted

## Case Study

### Scenario
Michael and Lisa, both age 55, have a $20 million estate. They want to ensure their three children receive maximum inheritance and have liquidity for estate taxes.

### Current Situation
- Taxable estate (post-2025): ~$20M - $14M exemption = $6M taxable
- Projected estate tax: $2.4 million
- No current liquidity planning

### ILIT Strategy

**Structure:**
- Survivorship (second-to-die) ILIT
- $3 million death benefit
- Annual premium: $30,000
- Crummey beneficiaries: 3 children

**Funding:**
- Each child: $18,000 Crummey power (2024)
- Total annual exclusion coverage: $54,000
- Remaining premium: gift from exemption (or covered by exclusions)

### 20-Year Projection

| Item | Without ILIT | With ILIT |
|------|-------------:|----------:|
| Estate (assumed stable) | $20,000,000 | $20,000,000 |
| Less: Premiums paid | $0 | ($600,000) |
| Net estate | $20,000,000 | $19,400,000 |
| Estate tax (40% on excess) | $2,400,000 | $2,160,000 |
| Net to children (estate) | $17,600,000 | $17,240,000 |
| ILIT proceeds | $0 | $3,000,000 |
| **Total to children** | **$17,600,000** | **$20,240,000** |
| **Net benefit** | — | **$2,640,000** |

### Additional Benefits
- Liquidity to pay estate taxes without selling assets
- Proceeds available immediately (no probate)
- Asset protection for beneficiaries
- Can be structured as dynasty trust

## ILIT vs. Other Strategies

| Strategy | Estate Exclusion | Gift Tax | Complexity | Flexibility |
|----------|-----------------|----------|------------|-------------|
| ILIT | Yes | Annual exclusion | Medium | Low |
| Personal ownership | No | N/A | Low | High |
| Corporate ownership | Varies | Varies | High | Medium |
| Cross-purchase | No | N/A | Medium | Medium |
