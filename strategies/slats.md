# Spousal Lifetime Access Trusts (SLATs)

## Overview

A Spousal Lifetime Access Trust (SLAT) is an irrevocable trust created by one spouse for the benefit of the other spouse (and often descendants). The SLAT allows couples to use their gift tax exemption to remove assets from their combined estates while maintaining indirect access to the transferred assets through the beneficiary spouse. SLATs have become increasingly popular as couples seek to lock in the current high exemption before the 2026 sunset.

## Key Benefits

- Remove assets and future appreciation from taxable estate
- Utilize current high gift tax exemption before 2026 sunset
- Maintain indirect access to assets through beneficiary spouse
- Protect assets from creditors
- Provide for spouse and descendants
- Avoid estate inclusion in either spouse's estate (if properly structured)
- Flexibility in distributions

### Why SLATs Work

**Gift Tax**: Completed gift removes asset from grantor's estate
**Estate Tax**: Not in grantor's estate (no retained interest)
**Access**: Beneficiary spouse can receive distributions
**Control**: Grantor maintains indirect control through trust terms

## Requirements

### Trust Requirements
- Must be irrevocable
- Grantor cannot be a beneficiary
- Grantor should not be trustee
- Must be properly funded with gift
- Valid under state law

### Avoiding Estate Inclusion (Critical)
To avoid IRC Section 2036/2038 inclusion:
- Grantor cannot retain right to income
- Grantor cannot retain control over beneficial enjoyment
- No implied agreement that grantor will benefit
- Independent trustee recommended
- Discretionary (not mandatory) distributions to spouse

### Gift Tax Requirements
- Completed gift for gift tax purposes
- File Form 709 (gift tax return)
- Use of lifetime exemption
- Consider adequate disclosure rules

### Spousal Considerations
- Must actually be married at creation
- Divorce terminates spousal benefit provisions
- Consider including provisions for divorce
- Beneficiary spouse can have limited powers

## Client Fit Criteria

### Ideal Candidates
- Married couples with combined estates exceeding exemption
- Those wanting to use exemption before 2026 sunset
- Couples with sufficient assets to gift while maintaining financial security
- Spouses in stable marriages
- Couples wanting asset protection
- Those with appreciating assets to transfer

### Financial Thresholds
| Combined Estate | SLAT Recommendation |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Under $13.6M | Generally not needed |
| $13.6M - $27M | Consider one SLAT |
| Over $27M | Consider reciprocal SLATs (with care) |
| High appreciation expected | Strong candidate |

### Less Ideal Candidates
- Couples with marital discord or divorce risk
- Those who need direct access to assets
- Couples with insufficient assets after funding
- Situations where beneficiary spouse has health issues
- Couples in community property states (special planning needed)

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Planning

1. **Financial Analysis**
   - Calculate combined estate value
   - Project future growth
   - Determine exemption utilization strategy
   - Ensure grantor spouse retains sufficient assets

2. **SLAT Design**
   - Determine funding amount
   - Select beneficiaries (spouse + descendants)
   - Draft distribution standards
   - Consider generation-skipping provisions
   - Include divorce provisions

3. **Trustee Selection**
   - Independent trustee preferred
   - Non-grantor spouse can be trustee with limitations
   - Consider trust protector
   - Successor trustee provisions

4. **Reciprocal SLAT Considerations**
   - If both spouses creating SLATs, must be materially different
   - Uncrossed trusts avoid reciprocal trust doctrine
   - Different assets, terms, trustees, beneficiaries
   - Timing considerations

### Phase 2: Creation and Funding

1. **Draft Trust Document**
   - Work with qualified estate attorney
   - Include all necessary provisions
   - Address contingencies (divorce, death, etc.)
   - Consider state law implications

2. **Execute Trust**
   - Proper execution under state law
   - Obtain EIN
   - Open trust bank account
   - Establish record-keeping

3. **Fund Trust**
   - Transfer assets to trust
   - Consider asset selection:
     - Appreciating assets (maximize growth outside estate)
     - Income-producing assets (support distributions)
     - Liquid assets (for trustee flexibility)
   - Document transfers

4. **Gift Tax Reporting**
   - File Form 709
   - Report gift at fair market value
   - Attach appraisals if required
   - Adequate disclosure to start statute of limitations

### Phase 3: Ongoing Administration

1. **Trust Operations**
   - Trustee manages assets
   - Makes distributions per trust terms
   - Maintains records
   - Prepares accountings

2. **Tax Compliance**
   - If grantor trust: no separate return (income on grantor's 1040)
   - If non-grantor trust: Form 1041 required
   - Track basis in assets
   - K-1s if non-grantor trust

3. **Distribution Planning**
   - Coordinate with beneficiary spouse's needs
   - Consider tax implications of distributions
   - Document distribution decisions
   - Annual distribution review

## Reciprocal SLATs

### The Issue
If each spouse creates nearly identical SLATs for the other, IRS may apply the "reciprocal trust doctrine" and treat each spouse as the grantor of the trust benefiting themselves—causing estate inclusion.

### Avoiding Reciprocal Trust Problems

**Different Provisions Strategy:**

| Feature | Husband's SLAT | Wife's SLAT |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Funding | $10 million | $8 million |
| Assets | Real estate | Securities |
| Trustee | ABC Trust Co. | XYZ Trust Co. |
| Distribution Standard | HEMS | Broad discretion |
| Beneficiaries | Wife, children | Husband, children, charities |
| Creation Date | January 2024 | September 2024 |

### Best Practices for Dual SLATs
1. Materially different terms
2. Different funding amounts (at least 10-20% variance)
3. Different trustees
4. Different assets
5. Stagger creation dates (6+ months apart)
6. Different distribution standards
7. Different successor beneficiaries
8. Document independent decision-making

## SLAT Distribution Standards

### HEMS Standard
"Health, Education, Maintenance, and Support"
- Ascertainable standard
- Allows beneficiary spouse to serve as trustee
- Limits discretion but provides access
- Common in SLATs

### Broad Discretionary Standard
- Trustee has full discretion
- More flexibility
- Requires independent trustee
- Greater asset protection

### Hybrid Approach
- HEMS for spouse distributions
- Broader standard for descendants
- Balance access with protection

## Risks & Considerations

### Divorce Risk (Primary Concern)
- If couple divorces, spousal access terminates
- Grantor loses all access to assets
- Consider:
  - Divorce provisions in trust
  - Adequate separate assets for grantor
  - Prenuptial/postnuptial agreements
  - Insurance planning

### Estate Inclusion Risks
- **Retained interest**: If grantor retains any beneficial interest
- **Implied agreement**: If understanding exists that grantor will benefit
- **Trustee powers**: Grantor as trustee can cause inclusion
- **Reciprocal trusts**: Substantially similar trusts collapsed

### Creditor Risks
- Self-settled trust rules may apply if access too direct
- Varies significantly by state
- Proper structure provides spouse protection
- Not self-settled (grantor is not beneficiary)

### Financial Security Risks
- Assets transferred irrevocably
- Must retain sufficient separate assets
- Consider need for long-term care
- Market volatility can affect both trust and separate assets

### Tax Law Change Risks
- Exemption sunset (planned for 2026)
- Potential retroactive changes (unlikely)
- State estate tax considerations
- Future law changes unpredictable

## Case Study

### Scenario
David and Elizabeth, both age 58, have a combined estate of $35 million. They're concerned about the exemption sunset in 2026 and want to lock in current benefits while maintaining access to funds.

### Current Situation
- David's assets: $20 million
- Elizabeth's assets: $15 million
- Combined: $35 million
- 2024 combined exemption: $27.22 million
- Projected 2026 exemption: ~$14 million
- Potential estate tax (no planning): ~$8.4 million

### SLAT Strategy

**David Creates SLAT #1 (January 2024):**
- Funding: $12 million (securities and real estate)
- Beneficiaries: Elizabeth, children, grandchildren
- Trustee: Independent trust company
- Distribution standard: Full discretion for Elizabeth's benefit
- GST exemption allocated: $12 million

**Elizabeth Creates SLAT #2 (September 2024):**
- Funding: $10 million (different securities, business interest)
- Beneficiaries: David, children (NOT grandchildren)
- Trustee: Different trust company
- Distribution standard: HEMS for David
- GST exemption allocated: $10 million

### Results

| Metric | Without SLATs | With SLATs |
|--------|-------------:|------------:|
| Combined estate | $35,000,000 | $13,000,000 |
| Less 2026 exemption | ($14,000,000) | ($14,000,000) |
| Taxable estate | $21,000,000 | $0 |
| Estate tax (40%) | $8,400,000 | $0 |
| **Tax savings** | — | **$8,400,000** |

### Access Maintained
- David can receive distributions from Elizabeth's SLAT
- Elizabeth can receive distributions from David's SLAT
- Each retains $3-5 million in personal assets
- Trusts can pay for family expenses
- Effective economic position largely unchanged

### Growth Exclusion Benefit
Assuming 6% annual growth over 20 years:

| Trust | Initial Value | Value at 20 Years | Estate Tax Saved on Growth |
|-------|-------------:|------------------:|---------------------------:|
| SLAT #1 | $12,000,000 | $38,485,000 | $10,594,000 |
| SLAT #2 | $10,000,000 | $32,071,000 | $8,828,400 |
| **Total Growth Savings** | | | **$19,422,400** |

## SLAT vs. Other Strategies

| Strategy | Spousal Access | Control | Estate Exclusion | Complexity |
|----------|---------------|---------|-----------------|------------|
| SLAT | Yes (indirect) | Moderate | Full | Medium-High |
| Direct Gift to Spouse | Full | None | No | Low |
| GRAT | No | During term | Yes (appreciation) | Medium |
| FLP/LLC Gift | Varies | Yes | Yes (discounted) | High |
| IDGT Sale | No | No | Yes | High |
