# Bonus Depreciation

## Overview

Bonus depreciation allows businesses to immediately deduct **100%** of the cost of qualifying property in the year it's placed in service. The **One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)** of 2025 restored 100% bonus depreciation permanently for property placed in service after January 20, 2025, reversing the TCJA phase-out. This is one of the most powerful tax strategies available, particularly when combined with cost segregation for real estate.

## Effective Dates & Key Law Changes (OBBBA Update)

| Year Placed in Service | Bonus Rate | Status |
|------------------------|------------|--------|
| 2022 | 100% | TCJA |
| 2023 | 80% | TCJA phase-out |
| 2024 | 60% | TCJA phase-out |
| Jan 1 - Jan 19, 2025 | 40% | TCJA phase-out |
| **Jan 20, 2025+** | **100%** | **OBBBA - Permanent** |

**OBBBA Restored 100% Bonus Depreciation Permanently:** Property placed in service after January 20, 2025 qualifies for 100% first-year depreciation with no phase-out schedule.

## Client Fit Criteria

### Ideal Candidates
- Businesses making significant capital purchases
- Real estate investors (combined with cost segregation)
- Manufacturing and construction companies
- Professional practices acquiring equipment
- Businesses with current taxable income to offset

### Good Candidates
- Growing businesses expanding operations
- Companies replacing aging equipment
- Real estate developers
- Vehicle-intensive businesses

### Less Ideal
- Businesses without current taxable income
- Companies with NOL carryforwards
- Pass-through entities with passive investors
- Businesses planning sale in near term

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Asset Identification

1. **Inventory Qualifying Property**
   - List all assets acquired during year
   - Identify recovery periods
   - Confirm 20-year or less classification
   - Note placed-in-service dates

2. **Real Estate Cost Segregation**
   - Engage cost segregation study
   - Identify short-lived property (5, 7, 15 years)
   - Separate land and land improvements
   - Calculate bonus-eligible components

### Step 2: Calculate Deductions

1. **Standard Bonus Calculation**
   ```
   Bonus Depreciation = Cost × Bonus Rate
   Remaining Basis = Cost - Bonus Depreciation
   Regular Depreciation = Remaining Basis × MACRS Rate
   ```

2. **Example: $500,000 Equipment (2025+)**
   - Bonus depreciation (100%): $500,000
   - Remaining basis: $0
   - Regular MACRS: $0
   - **Total Year 1 deduction: $500,000**

### Step 3: Consider Elections

1. **Election Out of Bonus**
   - May elect out of bonus depreciation
   - By class of property
   - Useful for NOL management
   - Irrevocable once made

2. **ADS Election**
   - Alternative Depreciation System
   - Longer lives, no bonus
   - May be required for certain property
   - Consider for foreign use property

### Step 4: Tax Return Filing

1. **Required Forms**
   - Form 4562 (Depreciation and Amortization)
   - Part II for bonus depreciation
   - Attach cost segregation study summary

2. **Documentation**
   - Retain purchase documentation
   - Placed-in-service evidence
   - Cost segregation reports
   - Election statements if applicable

## Section 179 vs. Bonus Depreciation (2025+)

| Feature | Section 179 | Bonus Depreciation |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Maximum (2025) | $1,250,000 | **No limit** |
| Phase-out threshold | $3,130,000 | None |
| Income limitation | Business income | **None (can create loss)** |
| Asset types | More limited | Broader |
| Used property | Yes | Yes |
| Real property | Limited | **Yes (via cost seg)** |
| Election | Elective | Automatic (can opt out) |
| Rate (2025+) | 100% (up to limit) | **100% (permanent)** |

### When to Use Each

**Use Section 179 when:**
- Want certainty of deduction
- Have sufficient business income
- Property qualifies for both
- Below phase-out threshold

**Use Bonus Depreciation when:**
- Need deduction exceeding Section 179 limits
- Want to create a loss
- Property doesn't qualify for 179
- Maximizing deductions for real estate

## Bonus Depreciation + Cost Segregation

### The Power Combination

Real estate normally depreciates over 27.5 or 39 years. Cost segregation identifies components eligible for bonus depreciation:

| Component | Standard Life | After Cost Seg | Bonus Eligible |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| Building shell | 39 years | 39 years | No |
| Carpet | 39 years | 5 years | Yes |
| Site improvements | 39 years | 15 years | Yes |
| Decorative fixtures | 39 years | 5 years | Yes |
| Special electrical | 39 years | 5-7 years | Yes |

### Case Study

**$2,000,000 Commercial Building (2025+)**

**Without Cost Segregation:**
- Annual depreciation: $51,282 ($2M ÷ 39 years)
- Year 1 deduction: $51,282

**With Cost Segregation + 100% Bonus:**
- Building (70%): $1,400,000 → 39-year depreciation
- 5-year property (15%): $300,000 → **100% bonus eligible**
- 15-year property (15%): $300,000 → **100% bonus eligible**

Year 1 Calculation:
- Building depreciation: $35,897
- 5-year bonus (100%): **$300,000**
- 15-year bonus (100%): **$300,000**
- **Total Year 1: $635,897**

**Benefit**: $584,615 additional Year 1 deduction (vs. straight-line)

**Tax Savings at 37% rate**: $216,308 in Year 1

## Risks & Considerations

### Depreciation Recapture
- Section 1245: Recaptured at ordinary rates
- Section 1250: Unrecaptured gain at 25%
- Accelerated depreciation increases recapture
- Plan for recapture on disposition

### Passive Activity Limitations
- Rental real estate generally passive
- Bonus depreciation creates larger losses
- May be suspended without passive income
- REPS status eliminates limitation

### Business Interest Limitations
- Section 163(j) limits business interest deduction
- ATI calculation affected by depreciation
- Election to use slower depreciation
- Trade-off analysis required

### AMT Considerations
- Corporate AMT eliminated (mostly)
- Individual AMT may apply
- Preferences can limit benefit
- Model both regular and AMT

### State Conformity
| State Conformity | Examples |
|-----------------|----------|
| Full conformity | Many states |
| No bonus allowed | California, New York |
| Partial conformity | Pennsylvania |
| Modified rules | Various |

## Planning Strategies

### Year-End Planning
- Accelerate purchases into current year
- Placed-in-service date critical
- Consider delivery and setup timing
- Document placed-in-service evidence

### Multi-Year Planning (Post-OBBBA)
- 100% bonus depreciation now permanent
- No need to accelerate for rate concerns
- Focus on business timing needs
- Coordinate with other tax strategies

### Loss Planning
- Bonus can create NOLs
- NOLs now limited to 80% of income
- Carryforward indefinitely
- Consider timing of deductions
