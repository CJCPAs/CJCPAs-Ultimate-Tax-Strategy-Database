# Bonus Depreciation

## Overview

Bonus depreciation allows businesses to immediately deduct a significant percentage of the cost of qualifying property in the year it's placed in service, rather than depreciating it over the asset's useful life. This powerful tax strategy accelerates deductions and improves cash flow, particularly beneficial when combined with cost segregation for real estate.

## Key Benefits

- Immediate deduction of asset costs
- Improved cash flow through tax deferral
- No dollar limit on bonus depreciation
- Applies to new AND used property
- Synergizes with cost segregation
- Available for wide range of assets

## Current Bonus Depreciation Rates

| Year Placed in Service | Bonus Depreciation Rate |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| 2022 | 100% |
| 2023 | 80% |
| 2024 | 60% |
| 2025 | 40% |
| 2026 | 20% |
| 2027+ | 0% |

*Note: Congress may extend or modify these rates. Monitor legislative developments.*

## Effective Dates

| Provision | Effective Date | Expiration/Phase-out |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| 100% Bonus Depreciation | Property placed in service after September 27, 2017 | Phased down starting 2023 |
| Used Property Eligibility | September 28, 2017 | Follows bonus phase-out |
| Qualified Improvement Property | January 1, 2018 (retroactive fix via CARES Act 2020) | Follows bonus phase-out |

**2026 Tax Year**: Only 20% bonus depreciation available for property placed in service in 2026. Consider accelerating asset purchases to 2025 (40%) for greater tax benefit.

## Client Fit Criteria

### Ideal Candidates
- Businesses making significant capital purchases
- Real estate investors (combined with cost segregation)
- Manufacturing and construction companies
- Professional practices acquiring equipment
- Businesses with current taxable income to offset

### Good Candidates
- Growing businesses expanding operations
- Companies replacing aging equipment
- Real estate developers
- Vehicle-intensive businesses

### Less Ideal
- Businesses without current taxable income
- Companies with NOL carryforwards
- Pass-through entities with passive investors
- Businesses planning sale in near term

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Asset Identification

1. **Inventory Qualifying Property**
   - List all assets acquired during year
   - Identify recovery periods
   - Confirm 20-year or less classification
   - Note placed-in-service dates

2. **Real Estate Cost Segregation**
   - Engage cost segregation study
   - Identify short-lived property (5, 7, 15 years)
   - Separate land and land improvements
   - Calculate bonus-eligible components

### Step 2: Calculate Deductions

1. **Standard Bonus Calculation**
   ```
   Bonus Depreciation = Cost × Bonus Rate
   Remaining Basis = Cost - Bonus Depreciation
   Regular Depreciation = Remaining Basis × MACRS Rate
   ```

2. **Example: $500,000 Equipment (2024)**
   - Bonus depreciation (60%): $300,000
   - Remaining basis: $200,000
   - Regular MACRS (5-year, Year 1): $40,000
   - **Total Year 1 deduction: $340,000**

### Step 3: Consider Elections

1. **Election Out of Bonus**
   - May elect out of bonus depreciation
   - By class of property
   - Useful for NOL management
   - Irrevocable once made

2. **ADS Election**
   - Alternative Depreciation System
   - Longer lives, no bonus
   - May be required for certain property
   - Consider for foreign use property

### Step 4: Tax Return Filing

1. **Required Forms**
   - Form 4562 (Depreciation and Amortization)
   - Part II for bonus depreciation
   - Attach cost segregation study summary

2. **Documentation**
   - Retain purchase documentation
   - Placed-in-service evidence
   - Cost segregation reports
   - Election statements if applicable

## Section 179 vs. Bonus Depreciation

| Feature | Section 179 | Bonus Depreciation |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Maximum (2024) | $1,220,000 | No limit |
| Phase-out threshold | $3,050,000 | None |
| Income limitation | Business income | None (can create loss) |
| Asset types | More limited | Broader |
| Used property | Yes | Yes |
| Real property | Limited | Yes (via cost seg) |
| Election | Elective | Automatic (can opt out) |

### When to Use Each

**Use Section 179 when:**
- Want certainty of deduction
- Have sufficient business income
- Property qualifies for both
- Below phase-out threshold

**Use Bonus Depreciation when:**
- Need deduction exceeding Section 179 limits
- Want to create a loss
- Property doesn't qualify for 179
- Maximizing deductions for real estate

## Bonus Depreciation + Cost Segregation

### The Power Combination

Real estate normally depreciates over 27.5 or 39 years. Cost segregation identifies components eligible for bonus depreciation:

| Component | Standard Life | After Cost Seg | Bonus Eligible |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| Building shell | 39 years | 39 years | No |
| Carpet | 39 years | 5 years | Yes |
| Site improvements | 39 years | 15 years | Yes |
| Decorative fixtures | 39 years | 5 years | Yes |
| Special electrical | 39 years | 5-7 years | Yes |

### Case Study

**$2,000,000 Commercial Building (2024)**

**Without Cost Segregation:**
- Annual depreciation: $51,282 ($2M ÷ 39 years)
- Year 1 deduction: $51,282

**With Cost Segregation + Bonus:**
- Building (70%): $1,400,000 → 39-year depreciation
- 5-year property (15%): $300,000 → 60% bonus eligible
- 15-year property (15%): $300,000 → 60% bonus eligible

Year 1 Calculation:
- Building depreciation: $35,897
- 5-year bonus (60%): $180,000
- 5-year regular: $24,000
- 15-year bonus (60%): $180,000
- 15-year regular: $6,000
- **Total Year 1: $425,897**

**Benefit**: $374,615 additional Year 1 deduction

## Risks & Considerations

### Depreciation Recapture
- Section 1245: Recaptured at ordinary rates
- Section 1250: Unrecaptured gain at 25%
- Accelerated depreciation increases recapture
- Plan for recapture on disposition

### Passive Activity Limitations
- Rental real estate generally passive
- Bonus depreciation creates larger losses
- May be suspended without passive income
- REPS status eliminates limitation

### Business Interest Limitations
- Section 163(j) limits business interest deduction
- ATI calculation affected by depreciation
- Election to use slower depreciation
- Trade-off analysis required

### AMT Considerations
- Corporate AMT eliminated (mostly)
- Individual AMT may apply
- Preferences can limit benefit
- Model both regular and AMT

### State Conformity
| State Conformity | Examples |
|-----------------|----------|
| Full conformity | Many states |
| No bonus allowed | California, New York |
| Partial conformity | Pennsylvania |
| Modified rules | Various |

## Planning Strategies

### Year-End Planning
- Accelerate purchases into current year
- Placed-in-service date critical
- Consider delivery and setup timing
- Document placed-in-service evidence

### Multi-Year Planning
- Consider declining rates
- Accelerate purchases in higher-rate years
- Balance with business needs
- Model multi-year tax impact

### Loss Planning
- Bonus can create NOLs
- NOLs now limited to 80% of income
- Carryforward indefinitely
- Consider timing of deductions
