# Short-Term Rental Tax Strategies

## Overview

Short-term rentals (STRs) such as Airbnb, VRBO, and vacation rentals offer unique tax planning opportunities that differ significantly from traditional long-term rentals. The average rental period determines whether the activity is treated as a rental activity (passive) or a business (potentially non-passive), with dramatic implications for loss deductions and self-employment taxes.

## Effective Dates & Key Law Changes

| Provision | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 and Beyond |
|-----------|------|------|-----------------|
| Bonus Depreciation | 60% | 40% | 20% (2026), 0% (2027+) |
| Section 199A QBI | Available | Available | Scheduled to expire |
| Self-Employment Tax | Net earnings from self-employment | Same | Same |
| Material Participation | 7 tests | 7 tests | No change expected |
| Average Rental Period | <7 days = business | Same | No change expected |

**2026 Planning Alert:** Bonus depreciation phase-out significantly impacts cost segregation benefits. Act in 2024-2025 for maximum first-year deductions.

## Key Tax Classifications

### The 7-Day Rule (Critical Distinction)

**Average Rental Period < 7 Days = NOT Rental Activity**

| Average Rental | Classification | Loss Treatment |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| < 7 days | **Trade or Business** | Active if material participation |
| 7-30 days (with services) | Trade or Business | Active if material participation |
| > 30 days | Rental Activity | Passive (unless REPS) |

**Why This Matters:**
- Business losses can offset W-2/ordinary income
- No $25,000 passive loss limitation
- No AGI phase-out
- Self-employment tax may apply (negative)

### Material Participation Tests

**Must Meet ONE of Seven Tests:**

| Test | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| 1. 500 Hours | 500+ hours in activity during year |
| 2. Substantially All | Your participation is substantially all participation |
| 3. 100 Hours + Most | 100+ hours AND more than any other person |
| 4. Significant Participation | Multiple activities, 500+ hours combined |
| 5. Prior 5 Years | Material participation in 5 of prior 10 years |
| 6. Personal Service | 3 of prior 10 years for personal service activity |
| 7. Facts and Circumstances | Regular, continuous, substantial (rarely used) |

**Most Common for STR:** Test 1 (500 hours) or Test 3 (100 hours + most)

## Key Benefits

### Tax Benefits of STR Classification

| Benefit | Traditional Rental | STR (< 7 days, materially participating) |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Loss deduction | Limited to passive income | **Deductible against any income** |
| Cost segregation benefit | Passive losses | **Active losses** |
| 199A QBI deduction | Usually available | **Available** |
| Self-employment tax | Not subject | May apply (mixed) |
| Depreciation recapture | 25% rate | 25% rate |

### The STR Loophole

**Strategy:** Convert passive real estate losses to active losses

**How It Works:**
1. Acquire short-term rental property
2. Average rental < 7 days
3. Material participation (500+ hours)
4. Cost segregation study
5. **Result:** Large depreciation losses offset W-2 income

## Requirements

### Average Rental Period Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Average Rental Period = Total Rental Days / Number of Rentals
```

**Example:**
- Total nights rented: 180
- Number of separate rentals: 30
- Average: 180 ÷ 30 = **6 days** (qualifies as < 7)

**Include:**
- All rental periods
- Only periods where rent is charged
- Do not include personal use days

### Material Participation Documentation

**Essential Records:**
- Daily time logs
- Calendar entries
- Activity descriptions
- Third-party verification (emails, texts)
- Property management records

**Hours That Count:**
| Activity | Counts Toward Hours? |
|----------|---------------------|
| Guest communication | Yes |
| Cleaning/turnover | Yes |
| Marketing/listing updates | Yes |
| Bookkeeping for property | Yes |
| Repairs and maintenance | Yes |
| Travel to property (one-way) | Yes |
| Property research | Generally no |
| Investment decisions | Generally no |

### Extraordinary Personal Services

**For 7-30 Day Rentals:**
Must provide substantial services similar to hotel:
- Daily cleaning
- Concierge services
- Food service
- Entertainment coordination
- Personal services

**Without Services:** 7-30 day rentals = Passive rental activity

## Client Fit Criteria

### Ideal Candidates for STR Strategy

| Characteristic | Why Favorable |
|----------------|---------------|
| High W-2 income | Benefit from offsetting active losses |
| Time availability | Can meet 500+ hours material participation |
| Tourism location property | Supports < 7-day average |
| Hands-on management | Not using property manager for everything |
| Cost segregation opportunity | New purchase or renovation |
| Real estate interest | Willing to be involved |

### Who Should Consider Alternative Strategies

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| No time for 500+ hours | May not qualify for active treatment |
| Using full-service property manager | Document your own hours carefully |
| Long average rental period | May be better as REPS or passive |
| Avoiding SE tax is priority | Structure as rental, not business |

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Property Selection

1. **Choose STR-Appropriate Location**
   - Tourist destinations
   - Business travel areas
   - Event/conference locations
   - Markets supporting < 7-day stays

2. **Analyze Rental Data**
   - Average booking length in market
   - Seasonal patterns
   - Occupancy rates
   - Competitive analysis

3. **Consider Local Regulations**
   - STR permits required?
   - Zoning restrictions
   - HOA limitations
   - Tax registration requirements

### Phase 2: Structure Planning

1. **Entity Structure**
   - LLC for liability protection
   - Consider state law implications
   - Disregarded entity vs. partnership
   - Self-rental considerations if applicable

2. **Tax Classification Planning**
   - Project average rental period
   - Plan material participation hours
   - Document strategy from Day 1

### Phase 3: Cost Segregation (Critical for Losses)

1. **Commission Cost Segregation Study**
   - Identify 5, 7, 15-year property
   - Maximize bonus depreciation
   - Time with property purchase

2. **Sample Cost Segregation Results**

| Component | Recovery Period | % of Building |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Structural (39-year) | 39 years | 60-70% |
| Land improvements (15-year) | 15 years | 5-10% |
| Personal property (5/7-year) | 5-7 years | 20-35% |

**2025 Bonus Depreciation:** 40% on 5, 7, 15-year property

### Phase 4: Operations & Documentation

1. **Maintain Short Average Rentals**
   - Set minimum stay requirements carefully
   - Monitor booking patterns
   - Avoid long-term rentals that skew average

2. **Track Material Participation**
   - Daily time log
   - Contemporaneous records
   - Detailed activity descriptions
   - Keep for 7+ years

3. **Self-Manage Key Functions**
   - Guest communication
   - Pricing decisions
   - Marketing strategy
   - Turnover oversight

### Phase 5: Tax Compliance

1. **Schedule C vs. Schedule E**
   - STR with < 7-day average: Schedule C likely
   - Report rental income
   - Deduct all expenses
   - Claim depreciation

2. **SE Tax Considerations**
   - If Schedule C and net profit: SE tax applies
   - If net loss: No SE tax benefit
   - Consider S-Corp for profitable operations

## Tax Calculations

### STR Loophole in Action

**Scenario:** High-income physician, $500,000 W-2 income

**STR Purchase:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Purchase Price | $800,000 |
| Land (20%) | $160,000 |
| Building/Improvements | $640,000 |

**Cost Segregation Results:**
| Component | Amount | Bonus (40%) | Year 1 Deduction |
|-----------|--------|-------------|------------------|
| 5-year property | $120,000 | $48,000 | $48,000 |
| 7-year property | $80,000 | $32,000 | $32,000 |
| 15-year property | $50,000 | $20,000 | $20,000 |
| 39-year (building) | $390,000 | N/A | $10,000 |
| **Total Year 1** | | | **$110,000** |

**Operating Results:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Rental Income | $60,000 |
| Operating Expenses | ($35,000) |
| Depreciation | ($110,000) |
| **Net Loss** | **($85,000)** |

**Tax Impact (if material participation met):**
- Loss offsets W-2 income
- Tax savings: $85,000 × 37% = **$31,450**
- Plus state tax savings if applicable

### Comparison: STR vs. Traditional Rental

| Metric | Traditional Rental | STR (Material Part.) |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| $85,000 loss | Passive (suspended) | **Active (deductible)** |
| Tax savings Year 1 | $0 | $31,450+ |
| Cash flow impact | Wait for passive income | Immediate benefit |

## Self-Employment Tax Considerations

### When SE Tax Applies

| Situation | SE Tax? |
|-----------|---------|
| STR with net profit, Schedule C | Yes (15.3% up to cap) |
| STR with net loss | No |
| Rental activity (Schedule E) | No |
| S-Corp election | On reasonable salary only |

### SE Tax Mitigation

**Option 1: Incur Losses**
- Aggressive cost segregation
- Deductible expenses
- SE tax only on net earnings

**Option 2: S-Corp Election**
- Pay reasonable salary
- Remaining profit not subject to SE tax
- Must have consistent profits to justify

**Option 3: Real Estate Professional Status**
- If qualify, report on Schedule E
- No SE tax on rental income
- Must meet 750 hours + material participation

## State Tax Considerations

### State STR Issues

| State Concern | Planning Point |
|---------------|----------------|
| Nexus | May create income tax nexus in property state |
| Transient occupancy tax | Collect and remit (like hotel) |
| Sales tax | Some states tax short-term rentals |
| State depreciation | May differ from federal |
| Local licensing | Business license requirements |

### Multi-State Operators

- File returns in each property state
- Apportion income appropriately
- Track expenses by property
- Consider entity structure

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Not tracking rental periods | May not qualify for < 7-day treatment | Log every rental period |
| Insufficient hour documentation | IRS disallows active treatment | Daily time logs |
| Using property manager exclusively | May not have enough personal hours | Self-manage key functions |
| Mixing personal use | Allocation issues, hobby loss risk | Separate personal clearly |
| Missing cost segregation | Lost deduction opportunity | Commission study at purchase |
| Wrong schedule (E vs. C) | Incorrect tax treatment | Consult tax professional |
