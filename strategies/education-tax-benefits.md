### Who Qualifies?
- Legally obligated to pay the loan
- Actually paid interest during the year
- Not claimed as dependent
- Filing status not MFS

## Planning Strategies

### Strategy 1: 529 Superfunding

**5-Year Gift Tax Averaging:**
- Contribute up to $90,000 ($180,000 married) at once
- Treat as spread over 5 years for gift tax
- No additional gifts to same beneficiary for 5 years
- Immediate removal from estate
- Long-term tax-free growth

**Example:**
| Approach | Contribution | Growth (20 yrs @ 7%) |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| $18,000/year × 5 | $90,000 | ~$140,000 total |
| $90,000 lump sum | $90,000 | ~$348,000 |

### Strategy 2: Credit vs. 529 Coordination

**Maximize Both:**
1. Pay $4,000 of tuition directly (for AOTC)
2. Use 529 for remaining expenses
3. Claim $2,500 AOTC credit
4. 529 distributions tax-free for other qualified expenses

**Example:**
| Expense | Source | Tax Benefit |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| First $4,000 tuition | Out of pocket | AOTC: $2,500 credit |
| Remaining tuition | 529 | Tax-free distribution |
| Room & board | 529 | Tax-free distribution |

### Strategy 3: Grandparent 529 Strategy

**Before 2024 FAFSA Changes:**
- Grandparent 529 distributions counted as student income
- 50% assessed for financial aid
- Workaround: Wait until junior year

**After 2024 FAFSA Changes:**
- Grandparent 529 NOT reported on FAFSA
- No longer affects financial aid
- Grandparents can freely use 529

### Strategy 4: Change of Beneficiary

**If funds remain after education:**
- Change to younger sibling
- Change to future children/grandchildren
- Change to yourself (continuing education)
- Change to nieces/nephews

**Tax-Free Changes:**
- Same generation or younger
- Family members include wide range
- No limit on number of changes

### Strategy 5: Grad School Planning

**For high earners above credit phase-outs:**
- 529 still works (no income limits)
- Employer tuition assistance ($5,250 tax-free)
- Business expense deduction (if job-related)
- LLC if income drops (sabbatical year)

### Strategy 6: 529 for K-12

**$10,000/Year for Private K-12:**
- Federal tax-free distribution
- Some states don't conform (may tax)
- Consider state tax implications
- May reduce higher ed funding

**State Conformity:**
| State | K-12 Conformity |
|-------|-----------------|
| Federal | Yes, $10,000 |
| California | No (taxes distribution) |
| New York | Yes |
| Illinois | Yes |
| Many others | Varies |

## Risks & Considerations

### 529 Risks

**Non-Qualified Distributions:**
- Earnings taxed as ordinary income
- 10% penalty on earnings
- Exceptions: Scholarship, death, disability

**Overfunding:**
- Risk of having too much in 529
- Solution: Change beneficiary, new Roth IRA rule
- Can withdraw up to scholarship amount penalty-free

**Investment Risk:**
- 529 investments can lose value
- No guaranteed returns
- Age-based portfolios may be conservative

### Credit Coordination Risks

**Double-Dipping Prohibited:**
- Can't claim credit AND use 529 for same expense
- Must allocate expenses properly
- Documentation important

### Income Limit Risks

**Phase-Outs:**
- Credits phase out at moderate income levels
- Plan around income spikes
- Coverdell has strict income limits

## Case Study

### Scenario
The Johnson family has twins starting college in 2024:
- AGI: $150,000 (MFJ)
- Annual college cost: $40,000 per child
- 529 balance: $200,000 (split evenly)

### Optimization Strategy

**Year 1:**

| Student | Expense | Source | Tax Benefit |
|---------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Twin A - $4,000 | Tuition | Cash | AOTC: $2,500 |
| Twin A - $36,000 | All else | 529 | Tax-free |
| Twin B - $4,000 | Tuition | Cash | AOTC: $2,500 |
| Twin B - $36,000 | All else | 529 | Tax-free |

**Total Tax Benefits:**
- AOTC: $5,000 ($2,500 × 2)
- 529 tax-free: $72,000
- Tax savings: ~$5,000 + avoided tax on 529 earnings

### Four-Year Analysis

| Year | AOTC | 529 Tax-Free | Total Benefit |
|------|------|--------------|---------------|
| 1 | $5,000 | $72,000 | $5,000+ credit |
| 2 | $5,000 | $72,000 | $5,000+ credit |
| 3 | $5,000 | Remaining | $5,000+ credit |
| 4 | $5,000 | Remaining | $5,000+ credit |
| **Total** | **$20,000** | **$200,000** | **$20,000 credits** |

### Additional Strategies
- If AGI rises above $180,000: Maximize 529 (no income limits)
- Student loan interest deduction if applicable
- Remaining 529 rolled to grandchildren or Roth IRA
