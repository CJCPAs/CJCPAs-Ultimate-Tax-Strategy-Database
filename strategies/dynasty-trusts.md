# Dynasty Trusts

## Overview

A Dynasty Trust is a long-term irrevocable trust designed to pass wealth from generation to generation while minimizing or eliminating estate, gift, and generation-skipping transfer (GST) taxes at each generational level. By leveraging the GST tax exemption and establishing the trust in a state without a rule against perpetuities, families can create multi-generational wealth that grows tax-free for centuries.

## Effective Dates & Key Law Changes

| Provision | 2024-2025 | Post-OBBBA (2025+) |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| GST Tax Exemption | $13.61M (2024) / ~$13.99M (2025) | $15M permanent (OBBBA) |
| GST Tax Rate | 40% | 40% |
| Estate/Gift Exemption | Same as GST | $15M permanent (OBBBA) |
| Dynasty Trust Rules | Unchanged | Unchanged |
| State Perpetuity Rules | Varies by state | Varies by state |

**OBBBA Update (July 2025):** The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) permanently set the GST, estate, and gift tax exemption at $15M per person ($30M married). The previously scheduled 2026 sunset to ~$7M has been eliminated.

## Key Benefits

- Multi-generational wealth transfer (potentially perpetual)
- Avoid estate tax at each generation
- Avoid GST tax if properly structured
- Asset protection for beneficiaries
- Protection from beneficiaries' creditors and divorcing spouses
- Professional management across generations
- Income tax benefits (grantor trust during grantor's life)
- Flexibility through trust protector provisions

## How Dynasty Trusts Work

### Traditional Estate Transfer vs. Dynasty Trust

**Without Dynasty Trust (Each Generation Taxed):**
```
Generation 1: $10M → 40% tax → $6M to Gen 2
Generation 2: $6M (grows to $12M) → 40% tax → $7.2M to Gen 3
Generation 3: $7.2M (grows to $14.4M) → 40% tax → $8.64M to Gen 4

After 3 generations: $8.64M (multiple tax events)
```

**With Dynasty Trust (No Generation Taxes):**
```
Generation 1: $10M → Dynasty Trust (GST exempt)
Trust grows: $10M → $20M → $40M → $80M (no tax at each generation)

After 3 generations: $80M+ available for family (no transfer tax)
```

### GST Tax Exemption Allocation

**Critical Concept:** GST exemption allocated to trust "sticks" to trust assets

| Allocation | Result |
|------------|--------|
| Full GST exemption allocated | Trust is "GST exempt" forever |
| No GST exemption allocated | 40% GST tax at each generation |
| Partial allocation | Mixed—track inclusion ratio |

### State Selection for Dynasty Trusts

**Best Dynasty Trust States (No Rule Against Perpetuities):**

| State | Perpetuity Period | Other Benefits |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|
| South Dakota | Perpetual | No state income tax, strong asset protection |
| Nevada | 365 years | No state income tax |
| Delaware | Perpetual | Flexible trust laws |
| Alaska | 1,000 years | Asset protection, no state income tax |
| Wyoming | 1,000 years | No state income tax |
| New Hampshire | Perpetual | No income tax on trust |
| Tennessee | 360 years | No income tax on trust income |

**Avoid:** States with traditional Rule Against Perpetuities (lives in being + 21 years)

## Client Fit Criteria

### Ideal Candidates

| Characteristic | Why Important |
|----------------|---------------|
| Estate exceeds exemption (current or future) | Need to use GST exemption |
| Multi-generational planning goals | Dynasty structure fits objectives |
| Appreciating assets to transfer | More growth = more tax savings |
| Dynasty-state connection or willing to establish | Necessary for perpetual trust |
| Family values align with long-term planning | Multi-generation commitment |

### Planning Priority by Wealth Level

| Current Wealth | Priority for Dynasty Trust |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| Over $15M (single) | High—utilize full exemption |
| Over $30M (married) | High—utilize both exemptions |
| $10M-$15M | Moderate—depends on growth trajectory |
| Under $10M | Lower—evaluate other strategies first |

### Less Ideal Candidates
- Need access to all assets
- Uncertain family dynamics
- Small estate unlikely to grow
- Short-term planning horizon
- Resistant to professional trustee

## Implementation Steps

## Dynasty Trust Structures

### Grantor Dynasty Trust

**During Grantor's Life:**
- Income taxed to grantor
- Trust grows income-tax-free
- Additional wealth transfer (grantor paying tax)
- No income tax to trust or beneficiaries

**After Grantor's Death:**
- Becomes non-grantor trust
- Trust or beneficiaries pay income tax
- Stepped-up basis? (No—transferred assets)

### Dynasty Trust with Life Insurance

**Structure:**
1. Fund dynasty trust with cash gifts
2. Trust purchases life insurance on grantor(s)
3. Death benefit greatly multiplies GST-exempt fund
4. Proceeds grow for generations

**Example:**
- GST exemption used: $13,000,000
- Premiums fund $50,000,000 policy
- At death: $50,000,000 GST-exempt
- Multi-generational benefit: hundreds of millions

### Dynasty Trust with FLP/IDGT

**Leveraged Structure:**
1. Create FLP with appreciating assets
2. Gift discounted FLP interests to dynasty trust
3. Sell additional interests to trust (IDGT)
4. Discounts multiply GST exemption effectiveness

**Example:**
- $20M of assets in FLP
- 35% valuation discount
- Transfer value: $13M
- Use full GST exemption
- $20M+ (and growth) in dynasty trust

## Tax Considerations

### Income Tax Treatment

| Trust Type | Income Tax |
|------------|------------|
| Grantor trust (during life) | Grantor pays |
| Non-grantor trust | Trust/beneficiary pays |
| Distributed income | Beneficiary pays |
| Accumulated income | Trust pays (compressed brackets) |

**2026 Trust Tax Rates:**
| Taxable Income | Rate |
|----------------|------|
| $0 - $3,150 | 10% |
| $3,151 - $11,450 | 24% |
| $11,451 - $15,650 | 35% |
| Over $15,650 | 37% |

*Trusts hit highest bracket quickly—consider distributions*

### GST Tax Mechanics

**Inclusion Ratio:**
- 0 = Fully GST exempt (goal)
- 1 = Fully GST taxable
- Between = Partially exempt

**Taxable Distributions/Terminations:**
- Skip person distributions × Inclusion ratio × 40%
- Proper allocation prevents this

### State Income Tax Planning

**Strategies:**
- Establish trust in no-income-tax state
- Require non-resident trustee
- Avoid beneficiary-deemed-owner rules
- Monitor state law changes

## Risks & Considerations

### Legal Risks
- Rule against perpetuities (choose state carefully)
- State law changes
- Federal tax law changes
- Future legal challenges

### Family Risks
- Family discord over generations
- Different values across generations
- Beneficiary resentment
- Lack of motivation (trust fund baby)

### Administrative Risks
- Long-term trustee competence
- Rising fees over time
- Investment performance
- Record keeping for 100+ years

### Tax Law Change Risks
- GST exemption could be reduced further
- Dynasty trusts could be targeted
- State law changes
- *However: existing exempt trusts likely grandfathered*

## Case Study

### Scenario
Robert and Susan, both 60:
- Combined estate: $40,000,000
- Four children, eight grandchildren
- Goal: Multi-generational wealth preservation

### Dynasty Trust Strategy (Post-OBBBA)

**Structure:**
- Each spouse creates dynasty trust
- Fund with $15,000,000 each (full exemption under OBBBA)
- Allocate full GST exemption to each
- Total GST-exempt corpus: $30,000,000

**Assets Transferred:**
- FLP interests (with 30% discount)
- Actual value transferred: ~$42,850,000
- Gift/GST value: $30,000,000

### Projected Growth (No Additional Contributions)

| Generation | Years | Value (6% growth) | Estate Tax Saved |
|------------|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| Children (Year 25) | 25 | $129M | $51M |
| Grandchildren (Year 50) | 50 | $552M | $221M |
| Great-grandchildren (Year 75) | 75 | $2.4B | $960M |
| Great-great-grandchildren (Year 100) | 100 | $10.3B | $4.1B |

**Multi-Generational Tax Savings: BILLIONS**

### Comparison: Pre-OBBBA vs. Post-OBBBA Planning

**Pre-OBBBA Scenario (2024-2025):**
- Combined exemption: ~$27.98M (2025)
- Feared 2026 reduction: ~$14M (sunset to ~$7M each)
- Urgency: Critical planning before 12/31/2025

**Post-OBBBA Outcome (July 2025):**
- Permanent exemption: $30M ($15M per person)
- No sunset risk
- Planning timeline: More flexible, but still valuable for high-net-worth families
