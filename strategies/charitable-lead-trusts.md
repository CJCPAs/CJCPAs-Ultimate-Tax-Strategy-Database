# Charitable Lead Trusts (CLATs & CLUTs)

## Overview

A Charitable Lead Trust (CLT) is an irrevocable trust that provides income payments to one or more charities for a specified term, after which the remaining assets pass to non-charitable beneficiaries (typically family members). CLTs are powerful estate and gift tax planning tools that allow donors to transfer wealth to heirs at reduced transfer tax cost while supporting charitable causes. Under the OBBBA (One Big Beautiful Bill Act) signed July 4, 2025, the estate and gift tax exemption is now permanently set at $15M per person ($30M for married couples), making CLTs valuable tools for wealth transfer while supporting charitable objectives.

## Effective Dates & Key Law Changes

| Provision | Pre-OBBBA (2024-2025) | Post-OBBBA (2025+) |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Estate/Gift Tax Exemption | $13.61M (2024) / ~$13.99M (2025) | **$15M (permanent)** |
| Estate/Gift Tax Rate | 40% | 40% |
| Section 7520 Rate | ~5.0% (variable monthly) | Variable |
| Charitable Deduction | Available | Available |
| GST Exemption | Same as estate | **$15M (permanent)** |
| Income Tax Rates | TCJA brackets | TCJA brackets (permanent) |

**OBBBA Update (Effective July 4, 2025):** The permanent $15M exemption provides planning certainty. A "zeroed-out" CLAT remains highly valuable as it can transfer significant wealth with zero gift tax regardless of exemption level, making it particularly attractive for those who have already exhausted their exemptions or prefer not to use them.

### The "Zeroed-Out" CLAT

**Most Common Structure:**
- Design annuity payments so PV of charity interest = FMV of assets
- Gift tax value of remainder = $0
- No gift tax due, no exemption used
- All appreciation passes to heirs tax-free

**Formula for Zeroed-Out CLAT:**
```
Annual Annuity = FMV × Factor based on Section 7520 rate and term
```

### Section 7520 Rate Impact

| 7520 Rate | Effect on CLT |
|-----------|---------------|
| Higher rate | Lower PV of charity payments, higher taxable gift |
| Lower rate | Higher PV of charity payments, easier to zero out |

**Current Environment (2024-2025):** Higher 7520 rates (~5%) make zeroing out require higher annuity payments, but also mean trust must earn less to "beat" the rate.

## Key Benefits

### Estate/Gift Tax Benefits
- Reduce taxable gift/estate by PV of charitable payments
- Transfer appreciation to heirs free of transfer tax
- Leverage Section 7520 rate assumptions
- Zeroed-out CLAT uses no exemption

### Income Tax Benefits (Grantor CLT)
- Upfront charitable deduction for PV of all payments
- Useful in high-income year
- Deduction limited by AGI limitations (30%/60%)
- 5-year carryforward available

### Wealth Transfer Benefits
- All growth above 7520 rate passes tax-free to heirs
- Discount planning possible with hard-to-value assets
- Generation-skipping possible with proper planning

## Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- Irrevocable trust
- Payments to qualified 501(c)(3) charities
- Specified term (years or lives)
- Qualified remainder beneficiaries
- Proper trust document language

### CLAT Payment Requirements
- Fixed dollar amount (annuity)
- Paid at least annually
- Can increase up to 20% per year (graduated CLAT)

### CLUT Payment Requirements

- Based on annual FMV
- Recalculated each year

## Client Fit Criteria

### Ideal Candidates

| Characteristic | Why Favorable |
|----------------|---------------|
| Significant wealth (>$20M) | Meaningful transfer tax savings |
| Charitable intent | Must want to benefit charity |
| Long time horizon | Multi-year/decade trusts work best |
| Appreciating assets | Beat the 7520 rate |
| High-income year (grantor) | Maximize income tax deduction |
| Exhausted exemption | Zero-out strategy valuable |

### CLAT Suitability Analysis

| Situation | CLAT Benefit |
|-----------|--------------|
| Estate over exemption | High - reduces taxable estate |
| Used all gift exemption | High - zero gift tax possible |
| Expecting asset appreciation | High - appreciation passes free |
| Charitable family | High - aligns with values |
| Need current income | Low - income goes to charity |
| Short time horizon | Low - need term for benefits |

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Planning & Design

1. **Determine Objectives**
   - Wealth transfer goals
   - Charitable giving targets
   - Family dynamics
   - Time horizon

2. **Select CLT Type**
   - CLAT vs. CLUT
   - Grantor vs. Non-Grantor
   - Term of years vs. lives

3. **Choose Funding Assets**
   - Appreciating assets ideal
   - Consider valuation discounts
   - Liquidity for annuity payments

4. **Run Projections**
   - Different growth scenarios
   - Various 7520 rates
   - Term length optimization

### Phase 2: Document Preparation

1. **Draft Trust Agreement**
   - Qualified charity language
   - Payment terms
   - Remainder beneficiaries
   - Trustee provisions
   - Investment powers

2. **Obtain Valuations**
   - Appraisals for non-cash assets
   - Discount analysis if applicable
   - Document methodology

   - Deed real estate
   - Reassign securities
   - Document transfers

2. **File Gift Tax Return (Form 709)**
   - Report transfer
   - Claim charitable deduction
   - Attach actuarial calculations

3. **Ongoing Administration**
   - Annual charity payments
   - Trust accounting
   - Tax return filings (Form 5227)
   - Investment management

## Tax Calculations

### Zeroed-Out CLAT Example

**Assumptions:**
- Funding: $5,000,000
- Section 7520 Rate: 5.0%
- Term: 20 years
- Goal: Zero taxable gift

**Calculation:**
| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| FMV of Assets | $5,000,000 |
| Annuity Factor (5%, 20 years) | 12.4622 |
| Required Annual Annuity | $401,212 |
| PV of Charity Interest | $5,000,000 |
| **Taxable Gift** | **$0** |

**If Trust Earns 8% Annually:**
| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Initial Funding | $5,000,000 |
| Total to Charity (20 years) | $8,024,240 |
| Remainder to Family | $5,847,114 |
| **Transfer Tax Saved** | **$2,338,846** (at 40%) |

### Grantor CLAT Income Tax Benefit

**Same CLAT, Grantor Version:**
| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| PV of Charitable Payments | $5,000,000 |
| Donor's Tax Bracket | 37% |
| **Income Tax Savings** | **$1,850,000** |

**Trade-off:** Donor taxed on trust income for 20 years

### Graduated (Shark-Fin) CLAT

**Strategy:** Start with lower payments, increase over time

**Benefits:**
- Lower initial payments = more assets grow
- Higher payments later from appreciated assets
- Can still zero out

**Example (20% annual increase):**
| Year | Payment | Cumulative |
|------|---------|------------|
| 1 | $100,000 | $100,000 |
| 5 | $207,360 | $744,160 |
| 10 | $515,978 | $2,591,899 |
| 15 | $1,284,174 | $7,581,151 |
| 20 | $3,194,579 | $18,688,747 |

## Advanced Strategies

### Strategy 1: CLAT with Discounted Assets

**Use hard-to-value assets:**
- FLP/LLC interests (25-40% discount)
- Real estate
- Closely held stock
- Promissory notes

**Example:**
| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Asset FMV | $10,000,000 |
| Valuation Discount (35%) | ($3,500,000) |
| Gift Tax Value | $6,500,000 |
| Zero-out annuity based on | $6,500,000 |
| Actual assets working | $10,000,000 |

### Strategy 2: Supercharged CLAT

**Combine with Grantor Trust:**
1. Create Grantor CLAT
2. Take income tax deduction for PV
3. Pay income tax on trust income (but from outside trust)
4. Trust grows faster (no tax drag)
5. More to remainder beneficiaries

### Strategy 3: CLT for Generation-Skipping

**GST Planning:**
- Allocate GST exemption to remainder
- Charity payments not subject to GST
- Remainder passes to grandchildren GST-free

### Strategy 4: Testamentary CLT

**Fund at Death:**
- Estate tax deduction for charity interest
- Remainder to heirs
- No income tax benefit (non-grantor)
- Useful if didn't plan during life

## CLAT vs. GRAT Comparison

| Feature | CLAT | GRAT |
|---------|------|------|
| Payments to | Charity | Grantor |
| Charitable intent required | Yes | No |
| Mortality risk | No | Yes (grantor must survive) |
| Annuity flexibility | Fixed or graduated | Fixed or graduated |
| Zero-out possible | Yes | Yes |
| Income tax deduction | Yes (grantor CLT) | No |
| Gift tax deduction | Yes | No |
| Popularity | Moderate | High |

## Risks and Considerations

### Investment Risk
- Trust must generate returns to fund annuity
- If underperforms, principal depleted
- Less (or nothing) for remainder beneficiaries

### Interest Rate Risk
- Section 7520 rate changes monthly
- Lock in favorable rate at funding
- Higher rates = harder to zero out

### Mortality Risk (Lives-Based)
- If measuring life ends early, term ends
- Charity receives less, family more
- Consider term of years instead

### Tax Law Risk
- Charitable deduction rules could change
- Transfer tax laws could change
- Grantor trust rules could change

## Case Study

### Scenario

The Hendersons:
- Net worth: $30,000,000
- Already used exemptions ($27M between them)
- Want to transfer $10M to children
- Charitable family (support local hospital)
- Long time horizon (can wait 15 years)

### Without CLAT

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Transfer to children | $10,000,000 |
| Gift tax (40%) | $4,000,000 |
| **Net to children** | **$10,000,000** |
| **Cost to parents** | **$14,000,000** |

### With Zeroed-Out CLAT

**Design:**
- Funding: $10,000,000
- Term: 15 years
- Section 7520 Rate: 5.0%
- Annual Annuity: $963,423

**Projected Results (7% growth):**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Initial funding | $10,000,000 |
| Total to charity (15 years) | $14,451,345 |
| Remainder to children | $7,223,685 |
| Gift tax | $0 |
| **Effective transfer cost** | **$0** |

**If 9% Growth:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Remainder to children | $11,847,312 |
| Transfer tax saved | $4,738,925 |

### Comparison

| Metric | No CLAT | CLAT (7%) | CLAT (9%) |
|--------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| To children | $10M | $7.2M | $11.8M |
| Gift tax paid | $4M | $0 | $0 |
| To charity | $0 | $14.5M | $14.5M |
| Total family cost | $14M | $10M | $10M |
