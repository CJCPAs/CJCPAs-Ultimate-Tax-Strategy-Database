# Home Office Deduction

## Overview

The home office deduction allows self-employed individuals and certain business owners to deduct expenses related to the portion of their home used regularly and exclusively for business. This includes both direct expenses (solely for the office) and indirect expenses (allocated portion of home expenses). With the rise of remote work, this deduction has become increasingly important for entrepreneurs and gig economy workers.

## Key Benefits

- Deduct portion of rent/mortgage interest
- Deduct portion of utilities, insurance, repairs
- Depreciation on home office portion
- Simplified method available ($5/sq ft)
- Can create significant tax savings
- Establishes home as business location for mileage

## Requirements

### Two Primary Tests (Must Meet Both)

**1. Regular and Exclusive Use**
- Space used ONLY for business (exclusive)
- Space used on regular, ongoing basis (regular)
- Cannot be occasional or incidental
- Personal use disqualifies the space

**Exceptions to Exclusive Use:**

- Qualifies if administrative activities substantial

## Calculation Methods

### Method 1: Regular (Actual Expense) Method

**Calculate business percentage:**
```
Business Percentage = Square Feet of Office / Total Home Square Feet
```

**Or use rooms method:**
```
Business Percentage = Number of Office Rooms / Total Rooms
```

**Deductible Expenses:**

| Expense Type | Direct | Indirect |
|--------------|--------|----------|
| Office-only repairs | 100% | — |
| Painting office only | 100% | — |
| Mortgage interest | — | Business % |
| Property taxes | — | Business % |
| Rent | — | Business % |
| Utilities | — | Business % |
| Insurance | — | Business % |
| HOA fees | — | Business % |
| General repairs | — | Business % |
| Depreciation | — | Business % |

### Regular Method Calculation Example

| Item | Total | Business % (15%) | Deduction |
|------|-------|------------------|-----------|
| Mortgage interest | $15,000 | 15% | $2,250 |
| Property taxes | $8,000 | 15% | $1,200 |
| Utilities | $4,000 | 15% | $600 |
| Insurance | $2,000 | 15% | $300 |
| Repairs (general) | $3,000 | 15% | $450 |
| Depreciation | $3,500 | 15% | $525 |
| **Total** | | | **$5,325** |

### Method 2: Simplified Method

**Fixed rate per square foot:**
- $5 per square foot
- Maximum 300 square feet
- Maximum deduction: $1,500/year

**Advantages:**
- No depreciation calculations
- No records of actual expenses needed
- No depreciation recapture
- Simpler record keeping

**Disadvantages:**
- Maximum $1,500 deduction
- May be less than actual expenses
- Cannot carry forward excess

### Method Comparison

| Factor | Regular Method | Simplified Method |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Maximum deduction | Unlimited | $1,500 |
| Record keeping | Detailed | Minimal |
| Depreciation | Required | Not claimed |
| Recapture on sale | Yes | No |
| Best for | Large offices, high expenses | Small offices, simplicity |

## Depreciation Calculation

### Home Office Depreciation

**Only for homeowners (not renters):**
- Depreciate business portion of home
- 39 years for commercial (home office often treated as residential)
- Use residential rate: 27.5 years for dwelling

**Calculation:**
```
Annual Depreciation = (Home Basis × Business %) / 27.5
```

**Example:**
- Home basis (improvements only): $300,000
- Business percentage: 15%
- Annual depreciation: ($300,000 × 15%) / 27.5 = $1,636

### Depreciation Recapture

**Important consideration:**
- When selling home, must recapture depreciation
- Taxed at 25% rate (unrecaptured Section 1250 gain)
- Applies whether or not depreciation was claimed
- One reason simplified method is attractive

## Deduction Limitations

### Income Limitation

**Deduction cannot create a loss from business:**
- Gross income from business
- Less: Non-home-office business expenses
- Less: Home expenses deductible regardless (mortgage interest, taxes)
- = Limit for other home office expenses

**Carryforward:**
- Excess deduction carries forward
- Use in future years with sufficient income
- Indefinite carryforward period

### Ordering of Deductions

**Priority (use in this order):**
1. Business percentage of otherwise deductible items (mortgage interest, property taxes)
2. Operating expenses (utilities, insurance)
3. Depreciation

## Special Situations

### Renters

**Deductible expenses:**
- Business percentage of rent
- Business percentage of utilities
- Business percentage of renters insurance
- NO depreciation (don't own)

**Often results in larger deduction relative to homeowners** (rent may exceed mortgage interest)

### S Corporation Shareholders

**Cannot directly deduct:**
- Home office expenses on personal return
- Must set up accountable plan

**Accountable Plan Approach:**
1. S Corp establishes written accountable plan
2. Shareholder-employee submits expense reports
3. S Corp reimburses tax-free
4. S Corp deducts reimbursement

### Day Care Providers

**Special rules:**
- Exclusive use NOT required
- Must calculate time-based percentage
- Additional limitation applies

**Calculation:**
```
Time % = Hours Used for Day Care / Total Hours in Year
Space % = Day Care Square Feet / Total Square Feet
Deduction = Expenses × Space % × Time %
```

### Inventory Storage

**Exception to exclusive use:**
- Home must be sole fixed business location
- Space must be used regularly for storage
- Space must be separately identifiable

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Verify Qualification

**Document:**
- [ ] Space used exclusively for business
- [ ] Space used regularly for business
- [ ] One of the principal place tests met
- [ ] Self-employed or business owner (not W-2)

### Step 2: Measure and Calculate

**Record:**
- Total home square footage
- Office square footage
- Business percentage calculation
- Method choice (regular or simplified)

### Step 3: Track Expenses (Regular Method)

**Maintain records of:**
- Mortgage statements
- Property tax bills
- Utility bills
- Insurance premiums
- Repair invoices
- Improvement costs

### Step 4: Complete Form 8829

**Form 8829, Expenses for Business Use of Your Home:**
- Required for regular method
- Reports direct and indirect expenses
- Calculates depreciation
- Applies income limitation

### Step 5: Flow to Schedule C

**Deduction reported:**
- Schedule C, Line 30 (home office)
- Or appropriate business form (Schedule F, etc.)

## Risks & Considerations

### Audit Risk Factors

| Risk Factor | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| Large deduction relative to income | Higher scrutiny |
| Mixed-use space claimed | Challenge to exclusive use |
| Inconsistent documentation | Disallowed deduction |
| Home-based business with losses | IRS may challenge |

### Documentation Best Practices

**Maintain:**
- Photos of dedicated office space
- Floor plan with measurements
- Log of business hours in space
- All expense receipts
- Mortgage and utility statements

### Home Sale Implications

**When selling home:**
- Depreciation must be recaptured (25% rate)
- May affect Section 121 exclusion
- Business use portion may not qualify for exclusion
- Plan carefully before selling

**Example:**
- Home sold at $100,000 gain
- Total depreciation claimed: $10,000
- Section 121 exclusion: $90,000 (reduced)
- Recapture: $10,000 × 25% = $2,500

## Case Study

### Scenario
Maria is a freelance graphic designer:
- Works from dedicated home office
- Home: 2,000 sq ft, Office: 300 sq ft (15%)
- Gross business income: $120,000
- Non-home-office expenses: $30,000

### Home Expenses

| Rent | $24,000 | 15% | $3,600 |
| Utilities | $3,600 | 15% | $540 |
| Insurance | $600 | 15% | $90 |
| Internet | $1,200 | 50%* | $600 |
| Office repairs | $500 | 100% | $500 |
| **Total** | | | **$5,330** |

*Internet 50% business use assumed

### Simplified Method

- 300 sq ft × $5 = $1,500

### Comparison

| Method | Deduction | Tax Savings (32%) |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Regular | $5,330 | $1,706 |
| Simplified | $1,500 | $480 |
| **Difference** | **$3,830** | **$1,226** |

**Recommendation:** Use regular method (significantly higher)
