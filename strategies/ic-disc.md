# IC-DISC (Interest Charge Domestic International Sales Corporation)

## Overview

An IC-DISC is a special tax entity that allows U.S. exporters to convert ordinary export income into qualified dividend income, resulting in significant tax savings. The IC-DISC acts as an intermediary that receives commissions from the exporting company, with those commissions taxed at favorable qualified dividend rates to shareholders.

## Key Benefits

- Convert ordinary income (37%) to qualified dividends (20%)
- Tax savings of approximately 17% on export profits
- No federal income tax at IC-DISC level
- Commission deductible to operating company
- Permanent tax rate reduction (not deferral)
- Minimal compliance requirements

## How IC-DISC Works

```
                    Export Sale
Operating Company ───────────────► Foreign Customer
        │

### Tax Arbitrage
| Without IC-DISC | With IC-DISC |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Export profit taxed as ordinary income at 37% | Export profit paid as commission to IC-DISC |
| No benefit from export activity | IC-DISC distributes as qualified dividend at 20% |
| **Effective rate: 37%** | **Effective rate: ~27%** (blended) |

## Requirements

### IC-DISC Qualification
- Separate C corporation
- One class of stock with minimum $2,500 par value
- 95% of gross receipts from "qualified export receipts"
- 95% of assets as "qualified export assets"
- Must maintain separate books and records
- Annual election on Form 4876-A

### Qualified Export Property
- Manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted in U.S.
- Held primarily for sale or lease to foreign customer
- Maximum 50% foreign content
- Not used in U.S. before export
- Not sold for ultimate use in U.S.

### Excluded Property
- Property for use in U.S.
- Property depleting natural resources
- Certain short-supply items
- Unprocessed softwood lumber

### Commission Calculation (Two Methods)

**Method 1: 4% of Gross Receipts**
- IC-DISC receives 4% of qualified export receipts
- Simple calculation
- May exceed actual profit

**Method 2: 50% of Combined Taxable Income**
- IC-DISC receives 50% of export profit
- More complex calculation
- Often larger commission

### Calculation Example
```
Export Sales: $5,000,000
Cost of Goods: $3,500,000
Export Profit: $1,500,000

Method 1: 4% × $5,000,000 = $200,000
Method 2: 50% × $1,500,000 = $750,000

Commission = Greater of Method 1 or Method 2
Commission = $750,000
```

## Tax Savings Example

### Scenario
ABC Manufacturing has $3,000,000 in export profits. Shareholders are in 37% bracket.

### Without IC-DISC
```
Export Profit: $3,000,000
Corporate Tax (21%): $630,000
After-tax profit: $2,370,000
Dividend tax (20% + 3.8% NIIT): $563,646
Net to shareholders: $1,806,354
Effective rate: 39.8%
```

### With IC-DISC
```
Export Profit: $3,000,000
IC-DISC Commission (50%): $1,500,000

Operating Company:
Remaining profit: $1,500,000
Corporate tax (21%): $315,000
After-tax: $1,185,000
Dividend (23.8%): $281,430
Net: $903,570

IC-DISC:
Commission: $1,500,000
Tax at IC-DISC: $0
Qualified dividend (23.8%): $357,000
Net: $1,143,000

Total to Shareholders: $2,046,570
Effective rate: 31.8%
```

**Annual Tax Savings: $240,216** (8% rate reduction on $3M)

## S Corporation Ownership

### Enhanced Benefits
When operating company is S corporation:
- S corp deducts commission (reduces pass-through income)
- Commission taxed at 37% ordinary rate avoided
- IC-DISC dividend at 20% qualified rate
- Greater spread = larger savings

### Example (S Corp Owner)
```
S Corp Export Profit: $1,000,000
Without IC-DISC: $370,000 tax (37%)
With IC-DISC Commission of $500,000:
  - S Corp income: $500,000 × 37% = $185,000
  - IC-DISC dividend: $500,000 × 23.8% = $119,000
  - Total tax: $304,000

Savings: $66,000 (17% on commission)
```

## Risks & Considerations

### Compliance Risk
- Must meet 95% tests each year
- Failure disqualifies IC-DISC status
- Annual filing requirements
- Interest charge on deferred tax (if elected)

### Audit Considerations
- Export property qualification
- U.S. content requirements
- Commission calculation accuracy
- Arm's length arrangements

### Economic Substance
- IC-DISC must have legitimate purpose
- Cannot be used for non-export income
- Related party pricing scrutinized

### State Tax Considerations
- Some states don't recognize IC-DISC
- State tax may apply to dividends
- Evaluate state conformity

## IC-DISC vs. FDII Comparison

## Effective Dates

| Provision | Effective Date | Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| IC-DISC Regime | Deficit Reduction Act 1984 | Permanent |
| Qualified Dividend Treatment | Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Act 2003 | Permanent |
| 50% Combined Taxable Income Method | Long-standing | Active for 2026 |
| 4% Gross Receipts Method | Long-standing | Active for 2026 |

**2026 Tax Year**: The IC-DISC strategy remains fully available for 2026. Qualified dividend rates (0%, 15%, or 20% depending on income) continue to provide significant tax arbitrage compared to ordinary income rates. This is one of the few permanent export incentives in the tax code.
