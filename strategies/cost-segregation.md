# Cost Segregation

## Overview

Cost segregation is an IRS-approved tax strategy that accelerates depreciation deductions by reclassifying building components from 27.5-year (residential) or 39-year (commercial) property into shorter-lived asset categories (5, 7, and 15 years). When combined with bonus depreciation, this can generate massive first-year deductions.

## Key Benefits

- Accelerated depreciation creating immediate tax deductions
- Improved cash flow through reduced current tax liability
- Time value of money benefits
- First-year deductions potentially 20-40% of building cost
- Applicable to new construction, purchases, and renovations

## Asset Reclassification Examples

| Component | Standard Class | After Segregation | Bonus Eligible |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Carpet and vinyl flooring | 27.5/39 years | 5 years | Yes |
| Decorative lighting | 27.5/39 years | 5 years | Yes |
| Moveable partitions | 27.5/39 years | 5 years | Yes |
| Parking lot/sidewalks | 27.5/39 years | 15 years | Yes |
| Landscaping | 27.5/39 years | 15 years | Yes |
| Site utilities | 27.5/39 years | 15 years | Yes |
| Security systems | 27.5/39 years | 5 years | Yes |
| Kitchen equipment | 27.5/39 years | 5 years | Yes |

## Requirements

### Building Requirements
- Building must be owned (not leased) by taxpayer
- Basis in property must exist
- Property must be used in trade or business or for income production
- Minimum recommended building value: $750,000+

### Professional Requirements
- Qualified engineer or construction professional
- Understanding of tax depreciation rules

- Comprehensive written report

## Client Fit Criteria

### Ideal Candidates
- Real estate investors purchasing/constructing $750,000+ properties
- Commercial property owners
- Multi-family residential investors (5+ units)
- Business owners constructing or renovating facilities
- High-income taxpayers who can use passive losses

### Less Ideal Candidates
- Properties under $500,000 (study cost may exceed benefit)
- Raw land or land-heavy purchases
- Properties with minimal improvements
- Taxpayers in low tax brackets
- Properties held for short-term resale

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Feasibility Analysis

1. **Preliminary Assessment**
   - Gather property details (type, cost, date acquired/constructed)
   - Identify construction cost breakdown if available
   - Estimate potential reclassification percentage
   - Calculate estimated tax benefit

2. **Economic Analysis**
   - Compare study cost to expected benefit (minimum 3:1 benefit ratio)
   - Consider taxpayer's marginal tax rate
   - Evaluate ability to use deductions (passive loss rules)
   - Assess state tax implications

### Phase 2: Study Engagement

1. **Select Provider**
   - Choose engineering firm with tax expertise
   - Verify provider's audit defense experience
   - Request sample reports and references
   - Confirm fixed-fee arrangement

2. **Information Gathering**
   - Provide construction documents and blueprints
   - Supply cost details and invoices
   - Arrange site inspection access
   - Provide closing statements and appraisals

### Phase 3: Study Execution

1. **Engineering Analysis**
   - Site inspection conducted
   - Component identification and quantification
   - Cost allocation methodology applied
   - Asset life classification determined

2. **Report Preparation**
   - Detailed asset listing produced
   - Supporting documentation compiled
   - Tax calculations provided
   - Depreciation schedules generated

### Phase 4: Tax Implementation

1. **Current Year Acquisitions**
   - Apply bonus depreciation to eligible property
   - Calculate regular depreciation on remaining basis
   - Complete Form 4562 with proper asset classes

2. **Prior Year Acquisitions (Look-back Study)**
   - File Form 3115 for change in accounting method
   - Calculate Section 481(a) adjustment
   - Claim catch-up depreciation in current year
   - No amended returns required

## Bonus Depreciation Integration

### Current Bonus Depreciation Rate
**100% Bonus Depreciation - Permanent**

The OBBBA (One Big Beautiful Bill Act), signed July 4, 2025, permanently restored 100% bonus depreciation for qualified property placed in service after January 20, 2025. This makes cost segregation even more powerful by allowing immediate expensing of all reclassified short-lived assets.

## Effective Dates

| Provision | Effective Date | Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Cost Segregation (IRS-Approved) | 1997 (Hospital Corporation of America decision) | Permanent |
| MACRS Depreciation | 1986 (Tax Reform Act) | Permanent |
| 100% Bonus Depreciation (OBBBA) | January 20, 2025 | Permanent |
| Look-back Studies (Form 3115) | Long-standing | Active for 2026 |
| IRS Cost Segregation Audit Technique Guide | Updated 2022 | Current guidance |

**2026 Tax Year**: Cost segregation is extremely valuable for 2026 with permanent 100% bonus depreciation. Consider:
- Immediate expensing of all reclassified short-lived assets
- Look-back studies on properties acquired in prior years to capture missed depreciation
- Maximum first-year deductions available for qualifying property

### Calculation Example
$2,000,000 commercial building purchased in 2026:
- 25% reclassified as 5/7/15-year property = $500,000
- Bonus depreciation at 100% = $500,000
- Remaining $1,500,000 depreciated over 39 years

**First-year depreciation**: ~$538,500 vs. ~$51,000 without segregation

## Risks & Considerations

### Audit Risk
- IRS scrutinizes aggressive reclassifications
- Engineering-based studies provide best defense
- Maintain complete documentation
- Use reputable, experienced providers

### Recapture Risk
- Section 1245 recapture on disposition
- Accelerated depreciation reduces basis
- May result in ordinary income on sale
- 25% rate on unrecaptured Section 1250 gain

### Passive Loss Limitations
- Rental real estate generally passive
- Deductions may be suspended if no passive income
- Real Estate Professional Status exception
- Material participation required for REPS benefits

### State Variations
- Some states don't follow federal bonus depreciation
- State add-backs may apply
- Calculate state impact separately
- Consider state-level conformity

### Economic Substance
- Must have business purpose beyond tax savings
- Property should be held for appropriate period
- Flipping properties quickly may raise concerns

## Case Study

### Scenario
Investor purchases $3,000,000 apartment complex in 2026. Marginal tax rate: 37%.

### Without Cost Segregation
- Annual depreciation: $3,000,000 ÷ 27.5 = $109,091
- First-year tax savings: $109,091 × 37% = $40,364

### With Cost Segregation
- Engineering study identifies 30% as short-lived property: $900,000
- Bonus depreciation (100%): $900,000
- Standard depreciation on $2,100,000: $76,364
- **Total first-year depreciation: $976,364**
- **First-year tax savings: $361,255**

### Net Benefit
- Additional first-year savings: $320,891
- Study cost: ~$8,000
- **Net benefit: $312,891**

## Look-Back Study Strategy

For properties acquired in prior years:

1. **Eligibility**
   - Available for any property still owned
   - Must be depreciable property
   - No time limit on look-back

2. **Process**
   - Complete cost segregation study
   - Calculate depreciation under both methods
   - Determine Section 481(a) adjustment (catch-up)
   - File Form 3115 with current year return

3. **Benefits**
   - Claim all missed depreciation in one year
   - No amended returns required
   - Positive 481(a) adjustment fully deductible
   - No special IRS approval needed
