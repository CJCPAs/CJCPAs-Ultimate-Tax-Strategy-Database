# Section 179 Deduction

## Overview

Section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code allows businesses to deduct the full purchase price of qualifying equipment and software purchased or financed during the tax year, rather than depreciating it over time. This immediate expensing can significantly reduce taxable income in the year of purchase, improving cash flow and accelerating the tax benefit of capital investments.

## Key Benefits

- Immediate deduction for qualifying property (up to limits)
- Reduce current year taxable income dollar-for-dollar
- Accelerate tax benefits vs. multi-year depreciation
- Flexibility to elect amount (can be partial)
- Combines with bonus depreciation for maximum benefit
- Applies to new and used property
- No AMT adjustment (unlike certain depreciation methods)

## 2024 Section 179 Limits

| Limit | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| Maximum deduction | $1,220,000 |
| Phase-out threshold | $3,050,000 |
| Phase-out complete | $4,270,000 |
| SUV limit | $30,500 |

**Phase-Out Calculation:**
- Reduce $1 for every $1 of qualifying property over $3,050,000
- At $4,270,000+ in purchases, Section 179 = $0

## Qualifying Property

### Eligible Property

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Tangible personal property** | Machinery, equipment, furniture |
| **Off-the-shelf software** | Standard business software |
| **Qualified improvement property** | Interior improvements (non-structural) |

- Assembly line equipment
- Specialized tools

**Vehicles:**
- Heavy SUVs (over 6,000 lbs GVWR)
- Trucks and vans
- Specialized vehicles
- Qualified nonpersonal use vehicles

### Non-Qualifying Property

| Category | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Real property (buildings) | Use bonus depreciation or regular depreciation |
| Land and land improvements | Not depreciable (land) or use Section 179 (improvements) |
| Inventory | Held for sale to customers |
| Property used outside U.S. | Must be used predominantly in U.S. |
| Property from related parties | Some restrictions apply |
| Air conditioning/heating | Unless part of QIP |
| Property used for lodging | Hotels, motels (with exceptions) |

## Requirements

### Eligibility Requirements
- Property must be acquired for business use
- Must be placed in service during the tax year
- Business use must exceed 50%
- Must have taxable income to absorb deduction

### Business Use Percentage

**Mixed-Use Property:**
- If business use > 50%: Section 179 available
- Deduction limited to business-use percentage
- If business use drops below 50%: Recapture rules apply

**Example:**
- Equipment cost: $100,000
- Business use: 75%
- Maximum Section 179: $75,000

### Taxable Income Limitation

**Critical Rule:** Section 179 cannot create or increase a net operating loss

- Deduction limited to taxable income from all active trades/businesses
- Unused amounts carry forward indefinitely
- Combine income from all businesses for calculation

**Example:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Business income | $500,000 |
| Business expenses | ($400,000) |
| Taxable income before 179 | $100,000 |
| Section 179 elected | $200,000 |
| **Deduction allowed** | **$100,000** |
| Carryforward | $100,000 |

## Section 179 vs. Bonus Depreciation

| Feature | Section 179 | Bonus Depreciation |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Annual limit | $1,220,000 | None |
| Phase-out | Yes ($3,050,000) | No |
| Taxable income limit | Yes | No (can create NOL) |
| Carryforward | Yes (unused) | N/A |
| New vs. Used | Both | Both (since 2017) |
| Elected | Yes (choose amount) | Automatic (opt out) |
| Property types | More limited | Broader |
| 2024 rate | 100% (within limits) | 60% |

### Using Both Together

**Strategy:** Use Section 179 first (within limits), then bonus depreciation on remainder

**Example:**
- Equipment purchase: $2,000,000
- Section 179 elected: $1,220,000
- Remaining basis: $780,000
- Bonus depreciation (60%): $468,000
- Regular depreciation (7-year): $44,571
- **Total first-year deduction: $1,732,571**

## Client Fit Criteria

### Ideal Candidates

| Situation | Benefit |
|-----------|---------|
| High taxable income year | Reduce taxes with equipment purchases |
| Growing businesses | Write off expansion equipment |
| Profitable businesses replacing equipment | Immediate deduction |
| Year-end tax planning | Quick deduction if placed in service |
| Businesses with upcoming large purchases | Time purchases strategically |

### Timing Considerations

**Accelerate vs. Defer:**
| Scenario | Strategy |
|----------|----------|
| High income this year | Purchase and deduct this year |
| Expected higher income next year | Wait and purchase next year |
| Loss year | No benefit (carryforward only) |
| Approaching phase-out | Plan purchases across years |

## Implementation Strategies

### Strategy 1: Year-End Equipment Purchases

**Maximize deductions before year-end:**
1. Identify equipment needs for next 6-12 months
2. Purchase and place in service before December 31
3. Property must be operational, not just purchased
4. Document placed-in-service date

**Placed in Service Requirement:**
- Must be ready and available for use
- Not just purchased or received
- Installation must be complete
- Testing may be required

### Strategy 2: Section 179 + Bonus Depreciation Stack

**For purchases exceeding Section 179 limit:**

| Purchase | Amount | Method | Deduction |
|----------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Equipment 1 | $1,220,000 | Section 179 | $1,220,000 |
| Equipment 2 | $500,000 | Bonus (60%) | $300,000 |
| Equipment 2 | $200,000 | MACRS (7-yr) | $28,574 |
| **Total** | **$1,720,000** | | **$1,548,574** |

### Strategy 3: Vehicle Deduction Optimization

**Heavy SUV Strategy:**

| Vehicle Type | GVWR | Section 179 Limit |
|--------------|------|-------------------|
| Light passenger | < 6,000 lbs | ~$12,200* |
| Heavy SUV | 6,000-14,000 lbs | $30,500 |
| Trucks/vans | > 6,000 lbs (no limit) | $1,220,000 |

*Subject to luxury auto limits

**Example Heavy SUV:**
- Purchase price: $85,000
- GVWR: 7,000 lbs
- Business use: 100%
- Section 179: $30,500
- Bonus depreciation: (85,000 - 30,500) × 60% = $32,700
- **Total first-year: $63,200**

### Strategy 4: Timing Around Phase-Out

**If approaching $3,050,000 threshold:**
1. Defer some purchases to next year
2. Purchase most expensive items first (maximize 179)
3. Use bonus depreciation for excess

**Example:**
- Planned purchases: $3,500,000
- If all in one year: Section 179 = $770,000 (reduced)
- Split $2,000,000 in Year 1 and $1,500,000 in Year 2:
  - Year 1: Full $1,220,000 Section 179
  - Year 2: Full $1,220,000 Section 179
  - Total: $2,440,000 vs. $770,000

### Strategy 5: Leasehold Improvement Strategy

**Qualified Improvement Property (QIP):**
- Interior improvements to nonresidential buildings
- 15-year property (eligible for 179 and bonus)
- Must be improvements, not original construction
- Excludes: Enlargement, elevators/escalators, structural changes

**Benefit:**
- Immediate deduction instead of 39-year depreciation
- Can significantly accelerate retail/restaurant build-outs

## Vehicle Depreciation Deep Dive

### Luxury Auto Limits (2024)

**Passenger Vehicles (< 6,000 lbs GVWR):**

| Year | With Bonus | Without Bonus |
|------|------------|---------------|
| Year 1 | $20,400 | $12,400 |
| Year 2 | $19,800 | $19,800 |
| Year 3 | $11,900 | $11,900 |
| Year 4+ | $7,160 | $7,160 |

### Heavy Vehicle Exception

**Vehicles over 6,000 lbs GVWR:**
- Not subject to luxury auto limits
- Full Section 179 available (up to $30,500 for SUVs)
- Full bonus depreciation available
- Trucks, vans, SUVs may qualify

**Qualifying Heavy Vehicles:**
| Vehicle | GVWR | 179 Available |
|---------|------|---------------|
| Ford F-150 | 6,100-7,850 | Full (truck) |
| Chevy Suburban | 7,500 | $30,500 (SUV cap) |
| Mercedes G-Wagon | 6,945 | $30,500 (SUV cap) |
| Ford Transit Van | 8,550+ | Full (van) |

## Risks & Considerations

### Recapture Rules

**If business use drops below 50%:**
- Section 179 benefit must be "recaptured"
- Include as income in year business use drops
- Continue monitoring for depreciation period

**Example:**
- Section 179 deduction: $50,000
- Year 3: Business use drops to 40%
- Recapture = Excess depreciation claimed

### Taxable Income Limitation Risk

**Problem:** No benefit if no taxable income
**Solution:**
- Plan purchases in profitable years
- Combine with other income strategies
- Carryforward unused amounts

### AMT Consideration

**Good news:** Section 179 is NOT an AMT preference item
- No AMT adjustment required
- Same deduction for both regular and AMT

### State Conformity Issues

**Not all states follow federal Section 179:**

| State | Conformity |
|-------|------------|
| California | Different limits |
| New York | Limited conformity |
| New Jersey | Addback required |
| Illinois | Follows federal |
| Texas | No income tax |
