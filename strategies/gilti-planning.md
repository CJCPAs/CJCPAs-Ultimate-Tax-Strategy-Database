# Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) Planning

## Overview

Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) is a category of income introduced by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that requires U.S. shareholders of Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFCs) to include certain foreign earnings in their U.S. taxable income annually, regardless of whether those earnings are distributed. GILTI represents a fundamental shift from a deferral system to a current-inclusion system for certain foreign income.

## Effective Dates & Key Law Changes

| Provision | Permanent (Post-OBBBA) |
|-----------|------------------------|
| GILTI Inclusion | Required |
| Corporate Deduction (Section 250) | 50% |
| Effective Corporate Rate | 10.5% |
| Individual Rate | Ordinary rates (no deduction) |
| Foreign Tax Credit | 80% of foreign taxes |
| QBAI Exclusion | 10% of QBAI |

**OBBBA Update (July 2025):** The One Big Beautiful Bill Act made all TCJA provisions permanent. The Section 250 deduction remains at 50%, keeping the effective corporate GILTI rate at 10.5%. The previously scheduled reduction in the Section 250 deduction to 37.5% (which would have increased the rate to 13.125%) will NOT occur. Individual shareholders still receive NO Section 250 deduction.

## What is GILTI?

### Basic Concept

GILTI = CFC's Net Tested Income - (10% × Qualified Business Asset Investment)

**In Plain English:**
- Earnings from CFCs above a "normal" return on tangible assets
- "Normal return" = 10% of tangible asset basis
- Excess treated as intangible income
- Included in U.S. shareholder's income currently

### GILTI Components

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Tested Income** | CFC gross income minus: Subpart F, ECI, FPHCI, high-tax excluded, related dividends |
| **Tested Loss** | If CFC has loss under tested income rules |
| **Net Tested Income** | Sum of tested income - tested losses from all CFCs |
| **QBAI** | Quarterly average of CFC's depreciable tangible property |
| **Net DTIR** | Interest expense allocable to tested income |
| **GILTI Inclusion** | Net Tested Income - (10% × QBAI) + Net DTIR |

### GILTI Calculation Example

**U.S. individual owns 100% of CFC:**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| CFC Tested Income | $1,000,000 |
| CFC Tested Loss (from other CFC) | $0 |
| Net Tested Income | $1,000,000 |
| QBAI (tangible assets) | $2,000,000 |
| QBAI Exclusion (10%) | $200,000 |
| **GILTI Inclusion** | **$800,000** |

## Requirements

### Who is Subject to GILTI?

**U.S. Shareholders of CFCs:**
- U.S. person (citizen, resident, domestic entity)
- Owns 10%+ of CFC voting power OR value
- On any day during CFC's tax year

**Controlled Foreign Corporation:**
- Foreign corporation
- U.S. shareholders own >50% vote or value
- Looking at 10%+ shareholders only

### What is Tested Income?

**Included:**
- Gross income from active business
- Certain services income
- Manufacturing income abroad

**Excluded:**
- Subpart F income (taxed separately)
- Effectively connected income
- Dividends from related CFCs
- Foreign oil and gas income
- High-taxed income (election available)

### Qualified Business Asset Investment (QBAI)

**Counts as QBAI:**
- Tangible depreciable property
- Used in CFC's trade or business
- Quarterly average of adjusted basis
- Uses alternative depreciation system (ADS)

**Doesn't Count:**
- Inventory
- Land
- Intangible property
- Property not in trade or business

## Tax Treatment

### Corporate vs. Individual Shareholders

| Aspect | Corporate Shareholder | Individual Shareholder |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|
| GILTI Inclusion | Yes | Yes |
| Section 250 Deduction | 50% (permanent) | **None** |
| Effective Rate | 10.5% | Up to 37% |
| Foreign Tax Credit | 80% with limitations | Limited |
| Section 962 Election | N/A | Available |

### The Individual GILTI Problem

**Without Section 962 Election:**
- Full GILTI at ordinary rates (up to 37%)
- Limited foreign tax credit
- No Section 250 deduction
- Potentially taxed twice (U.S. + foreign + distribution)

**Example:**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| GILTI Inclusion | $500,000 |
| Individual Tax Rate | 37% |
| U.S. Tax | $185,000 |
| Foreign Tax Paid (20%) | $100,000 |
| FTC Limited | ~$80,000 |
| **Net U.S. Tax** | **~$105,000** |

### Section 962 Election

**Allows individuals to be taxed like corporations on GILTI:**
- Claim Section 250 deduction
- Use corporate rates
- Enhanced foreign tax credit

**Trade-off:**
- Subsequent distribution taxed as dividend
- Potential double taxation
- Must analyze total tax impact

**Section 962 Example:**

| Without 962 | With 962 |
|-------------|----------|
| GILTI: $500,000 | GILTI: $500,000 |
| No deduction | Section 250: ($250,000) |
| Taxable: $500,000 | Taxable: $250,000 |
| Rate: 37% | Rate: 21% |
| Tax: $185,000 | Tax: $52,500 |
| FTC: ~$80,000 | FTC: ~$80,000 |
| **Net: ~$105,000** | **Net: ~$0** (but dividend tax later) |

## Client Fit Criteria

### Who Needs GILTI Planning?

| Situation | GILTI Exposure |
|-----------|----------------|
| U.S. individual owns foreign operating company | High |
| U.S. corporation with foreign subsidiaries | High |
| U.S. person in foreign partnership owning CFC | High |
| Passive foreign investment | Usually PFIC, not GILTI |
| Foreign corporation with U.S. owner <10% | None |

### High GILTI Risk Indicators

| Characteristic | Why High Risk |
|----------------|---------------|
| Service business abroad | Low QBAI, high tested income |
| IP-intensive business | Low tangible assets |
| High-margin operations | More excess return |
| Low foreign tax jurisdiction | Less FTC available |
| Individual (not corporate) owner | No Section 250 |

## Planning Strategies

### Strategy 1: Section 962 Election

**For individual shareholders:**
1. Make Section 962 election on return
2. Compute tax at corporate rates with Section 250
3. Claim foreign tax credit
4. Plan for future distribution taxation

**Best When:**
- High GILTI inclusion
- Significant foreign taxes paid
- Plan to retain earnings in CFC

### Strategy 2: High-Tax Exclusion Election

**Exclude high-taxed CFC income from tested income:**

**Requirements (Final Regulations 2020):**
- Foreign effective tax rate > 18.9% (permanent under OBBBA)
- Calculated per CFC, per tested unit
- Election made annually

**Threshold Calculation:**
90% × (21% corporate rate × (100% - 50% Section 250)) = 18.9%

**Example:**
| CFC | Tested Income | Foreign Tax | Rate | Exclude? |
|-----|---------------|-------------|------|----------|
| CFC 1 | $1,000,000 | $200,000 | 20% | Yes (>18.9%) |
| CFC 2 | $500,000 | $50,000 | 10% | No (<18.9%) |

### Strategy 3: Increase QBAI

**More QBAI = Lower GILTI:**

| QBAI Increase | GILTI Reduction |
|---------------|-----------------|
| $1,000,000 | $100,000 |
| $5,000,000 | $500,000 |
| $10,000,000 | $1,000,000 |

**Ways to Increase QBAI:**
- Invest in tangible assets (equipment, buildings)
- Lease vs. buy analysis (owned = QBAI)
- Manufacturing vs. contract manufacturing
- Relocate tangible operations to CFC

### Strategy 4: Check-the-Box Planning

**Elective entity classification:**
- Elect CFC as disregarded entity → Branch income
- May avoid GILTI (but other issues)
- Elect subsidiary as corporation → Separate CFC analysis

**Caution:** Complex anti-abuse rules apply

### Strategy 5: Restructure for Tested Losses

**If have multiple CFCs:**
- Tested losses offset tested income
- Structure loss-generating activities in CFCs
- Consider consolidation of entities

### Strategy 6: Domestic C-Corporation Ownership

**If currently individual owner:**
- Contribute CFC stock to domestic C-Corp
- Corporation gets Section 250 deduction
- 10.5% effective rate (permanent under OBBBA)
- Dividends to individual taxed at 20% + 3.8%

**Analysis Required:**
- Corporate-level tax on GILTI
- Dividend tax on distributions
- Total vs. individual direct ownership

## Case Study

### Scenario

Dr. Martinez, U.S. citizen, owns 100% of MedTech Ltd (Irish company):
- Active medical device business
- 2025 tested income: $2,000,000
- QBAI (equipment, building): $3,000,000
- Irish tax rate: 12.5%
- Irish tax paid: $250,000

### GILTI Calculation

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Tested Income | $2,000,000 |
| QBAI | $3,000,000 |
| QBAI Return (10%) | $300,000 |
| **GILTI Inclusion** | **$1,700,000** |

### Option 1: No Section 962 Election

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| GILTI | $1,700,000 |
| Tax Rate | 37% |
| Gross Tax | $629,000 |
| FTC (limited) | ~$200,000 |
| **Net U.S. Tax** | **~$429,000** |

### Option 2: Section 962 Election

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| GILTI | $1,700,000 |
| Section 250 (50%) | ($850,000) |
| Taxable | $850,000 |
| Corporate Rate | 21% |
| Gross Tax | $178,500 |
| FTC (80% × $250,000) | $200,000 |
| **Net U.S. Tax** | **$0** (excess FTC) |

**Future Distribution:**
- If later distributed: Taxable dividend
- $1,700,000 × 20% = $340,000
- Plus 3.8% NIIT: $64,600
- **Total if distributed: ~$405,000**

**Recommendation:** Section 962 provides significant deferral, but plan for eventual distribution tax.

### Option 3: High-Tax Exclusion

| Item | Analysis |
|------|----------|
| Irish rate | 12.5% |
| Threshold (permanent) | 18.9% |
| Qualifies? | **No** (12.5% < 18.9%) |

Ireland's rate is below threshold—high-tax exclusion not available.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Ignoring GILTI for individuals | Unexpected tax bill | Annual CFC review |
| Not calculating QBAI | Overstated GILTI | Proper asset tracking |
| Missing Section 962 election | Higher tax | Analyze annually |
| Wrong FTC limitation | Lost credits | Separate basket rules |
| Failing to file Form 5471 | $10,000+ penalties | Timely compliance |
| Ignoring high-tax exclusion | Unnecessary GILTI | Calculate effective rate |
