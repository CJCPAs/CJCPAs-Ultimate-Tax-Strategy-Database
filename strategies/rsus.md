# Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)

## Overview

Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) are a form of equity compensation where employees receive the right to company shares upon meeting certain vesting conditions, typically continued employment over a specified period. Unlike stock options, RSUs have value even if the stock price declines (as long as it remains above zero). RSUs have become the dominant form of equity compensation at many public companies due to their simplicity and guaranteed value.

## Key Benefits

- Guaranteed value (unlike options that can become worthless)
- Simpler than stock options—no exercise decision needed
- Automatic income recognition at vesting
- Alignment with company performance
- No cash outlay required by employee
- Predictable taxation timing

### Tax Timeline

| Event | Tax Consequence |
|-------|-----------------|
| Grant | None |
| Vesting | Ordinary income = FMV of shares |
| Sale (within 1 year) | Short-term capital gain/loss |
| Sale (after 1 year) | Long-term capital gain/loss |

## Tax Treatment

### At Vesting (Taxable Event)

**Income Recognition:**
- FMV of shares on vesting date = W-2 income
- Subject to federal income tax
- Subject to state income tax
- Subject to FICA (Social Security and Medicare)
- Subject to additional Medicare tax (if applicable)

**Withholding Methods:**

| Method | Description | Shares Received |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Sell-to-cover | Employer sells shares to cover taxes | Net after tax shares |
| Net settlement | Employer withholds shares for taxes | Net after tax shares |
| Cash payment | Employee pays tax in cash | All shares |

### At Sale

**Basis Calculation:**
- Tax basis = FMV at vesting (amount taxed as income)
- Gain/loss = Sale price - Vesting FMV
- Character depends on holding period from vesting

**Example:**
- RSUs vest: 100 shares at $50/share = $5,000 income
- Sell later at $70/share = $7,000
- Capital gain: $7,000 - $5,000 = $2,000

## RSU Variants

### Time-Based RSUs
- Vest based on continued employment
- Typical schedule: 4 years with annual or monthly vesting
- Most common type
- Straightforward planning

### Performance RSUs (PSUs)
- Vest based on achieving performance metrics
- Targets: revenue, EPS, stock price, relative TSR
- May vest at 0% to 200%+ of target
- Uncertain tax outcomes until performance determined

### Double-Trigger RSUs
- Common in private companies
- Require two events: time-based vesting + liquidity event
- No tax until both conditions met
- IPO, acquisition, or direct listing triggers taxation

## Requirements

### Grant Requirements
- Written plan document
- Board/shareholder approval
- Proper documentation
- Compliance with securities laws

### Tax Requirements
- Income recognized at vesting (not grant)
- No Section 83(b) election for RSUs (unlike restricted stock)
- Employer withholding required
- Proper W-2 reporting

### 409A Considerations
- Standard RSUs generally exempt from 409A
- Deferred settlement RSUs may be 409A plans
- Must meet exemption or comply with 409A
- Penalties for non-compliance are severe

## Client Fit Criteria

### Planning Opportunities
- High-income executives with large RSU grants
- Those with concentrated stock positions
- Employees at companies with volatile stock
- Individuals with charitable giving goals
- Those planning major life changes (retirement, relocation)

### Tax Planning Triggers
- Large vesting events
- Change in tax residence
- Approaching retirement
- Charitable giving intent
- Estate planning needs

## Tax Planning Strategies

### Strategy 1: Withholding Optimization

**Problem**: Default supplemental withholding (22% federal, often 10.23% CA) may be insufficient for high earners.

**Solutions:**

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Increase withholding | Avoid underpayment penalty | Less immediate cash |
| Estimated taxes | More control | Requires discipline |
| Year-end withholding adjustment | Simple | May miss safe harbor |
| Sell additional shares | Covers actual liability | More shares sold |

### Strategy 2: Tax Bracket Management

**Multi-Year Vesting Planning:**
- Project vesting over multiple years
- Coordinate with other income sources
- Consider income bunching vs. spreading
- Plan for bracket changes

**Example:**
| Year | Salary | RSU Vesting | Total Income | Marginal Rate |
|------|-------:|------------:|-------------:|--------------:|
| 2024 | $300,000 | $500,000 | $800,000 | 35% |
| 2025 | $300,000 | $200,000 | $500,000 | 35% |
| 2026 | $300,000 | $300,000 | $600,000 | 35% |

### Strategy 3: Diversification Planning

**Concentration Risk Management:**
1. Sell immediately at vesting
2. Systematic sales over time
3. 10b5-1 plan for insiders
4. Hedging strategies (collars, prepaid forwards)
5. Exchange funds

**Recommended Thresholds:**
- Single stock < 10% of liquid net worth (conservative)
- Single stock < 20% of liquid net worth (moderate)
- Single stock < 30% of liquid net worth (aggressive)

### Strategy 4: Charitable Giving with RSUs

**Donate Appreciated Shares:**
1. Let RSUs vest (pay income tax)
2. Hold shares for 1+ year
3. Donate to charity or DAF
4. Deduct FMV, avoid capital gains

**Example:**
- RSUs vest at $50/share (paid tax on $50)
- Stock appreciates to $100
- Donate to charity
- Deduction: $100/share
- Capital gains avoided: $50/share × 23.8% = $11.90

### Strategy 5: Tax-Loss Harvesting

**After Stock Decline:**
- If stock drops after vesting, consider selling
- Recognize capital loss
- Can offset capital gains
- Up to $3,000 against ordinary income
- Carryforward unlimited losses

**Wash Sale Caution:**
- Cannot repurchase within 30 days
- Future RSU vestings may trigger wash sale
- Plan around vesting dates

### Strategy 6: State Tax Planning

**Multi-State Allocation:**
- RSUs typically sourced where services performed
- Vesting during move may split between states
- Some states (CA, NY) have aggressive sourcing rules
- Document work location carefully

**State Arbitrage:**
- Vesting in low/no income tax state saves significantly
- CA: up to 13.3% state tax
- TX, WA, FL, NV: 0% state income tax
- Must establish bona fide residence

### Strategy 7: Estate Planning

**RSUs and Estate:**
- Unvested RSUs included in estate at FMV
- Death may accelerate vesting (plan dependent)
- Consider life insurance to cover tax liability
- Plan for liquidity needs

## Double-Trigger RSU Planning

### Private Company Considerations

**Challenges:**
- No market to sell shares
- Tax due at vesting but no liquidity
- Uncertain timing of liquidity event
- Potential for large concentrated position

**Strategies:**
1. Build cash reserves for anticipated tax
2. Consider tender offer opportunities
3. Plan for 409A valuation increases
4. Secondary market sales (if permitted)

### IPO Planning

**Before IPO:**
- Understand vesting acceleration terms
- Project tax liability
- Plan for lockup period (typically 180 days)
- Set up 10b5-1 plan if possible

**After IPO:**
- Consider immediate diversification (after lockup)
- Implement systematic selling
- Manage state tax implications
- Charitable giving opportunities

## Risks & Considerations

### Tax Risks
- **Underwithholding**: Large tax bill in April
- **State sourcing**: Multi-state complexity
- **AMT**: RSUs don't create AMT preference, but high income may trigger
- **NIIT**: Additional 3.8% on investment income over threshold

### Investment Risks
- **Concentration**: Too much in single stock
- **Volatility**: Value can swing significantly
- **Company risk**: All eggs in one basket
- **Liquidity**: May not be able to sell (private company, blackout periods)

### Planning Risks
- **Vesting loss**: Leave company, forfeit unvested RSUs
- **Clawback provisions**: Misconduct may require forfeiture
- **Dividend equivalents**: May create tax before vesting
- **Death/disability**: Various outcomes depending on plan

## Case Study

### Scenario
Michael is a Senior Director at a public tech company with the following situation:

**Current RSU Holdings:**
- Year 1: 5,000 shares vesting (current FMV: $100/share)
- Year 2: 5,000 shares vesting
- Year 3: 5,000 shares vesting
- Year 4: 5,000 shares vesting

**Other Income:**
- Base salary: $250,000
- Annual bonus: $100,000
- Spouse income: $150,000

### Tax Analysis (Year 1)

| Item | Amount |
|------|-------:|
| Salaries | $400,000 |
| Bonus | $100,000 |
| RSU vesting (5,000 × $100) | $500,000 |
| **Total income** | **$1,000,000** |
| Federal tax bracket | 37% |
| California tax bracket | 13.3% |
| FICA (Medicare) | 2.35% |

**Tax on RSU Vesting:**
- Federal: $500,000 × 37% = $185,000
- California: $500,000 × 13.3% = $66,500
- Medicare: $500,000 × 1.45% = $7,250
- Additional Medicare: $500,000 × 0.9% = $4,500
- **Total tax: ~$263,250 (52.65% effective rate)**

### Withholding Shortfall

| Tax Type | Required | Withheld (Default) | Shortfall |
|----------|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Federal | $185,000 | $110,000 (22%) | $75,000 |
| California | $66,500 | $51,150 (10.23%) | $15,350 |
| Medicare | $11,750 | $11,750 | $0 |
| **Total** | **$263,250** | **$172,900** | **$90,350** |

### Recommended Strategy

1. **Increase withholding**: Request additional 15% federal withholding on RSUs
2. **Make estimated payments**: Cover remaining shortfall quarterly
3. **Sell-to-cover plus**: Sell additional shares at vesting
4. **Diversification**: Sell 50% of net shares within 60 days
5. **Charitable giving**: Donate appreciated shares to DAF
6. **Track basis**: Maintain records for future sales

### Four-Year Projection

| Year | RSU Income | Cumulative Tax | Shares Owned (if held) |
|------|------------|----------------|------------------------|
| 1 | $500,000 | $263,250 | ~2,370 net |
| 2 | $500,000 | $526,500 | ~4,740 net |
| 3 | $500,000 | $789,750 | ~7,110 net |
| 4 | $500,000 | $1,053,000 | ~9,480 net |

**If stock appreciates 50% over 4 years:**
- Value of shares: $14,220,000
- But still concentrated in single stock

**Recommended**: Systematic diversification of 50-75% of vested shares
