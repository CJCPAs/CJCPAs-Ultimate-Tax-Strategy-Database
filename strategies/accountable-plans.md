# Accountable Plans

## Overview

An accountable plan is an IRS-approved arrangement that allows employers to reimburse employees for business expenses without the reimbursements being treated as taxable wages. When properly structured, accountable plans provide tax-free reimbursements to employees while giving employers full deductions for the business expenses. This is particularly valuable after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated unreimbursed employee business expense deductions.

## Key Benefits

- Tax-free reimbursements to employees (no income tax)
- No FICA taxes on reimbursements (employer and employee)
- Full deduction for employer
- Employees don't need to itemize deductions
- Avoids 2% AGI floor (pre-TCJA) and TCJA elimination
- Simple administration when properly structured
- Flexibility in covered expenses

## How Accountable Plans Work

### Tax Treatment Comparison

| Expense Method | Employee Tax | Employer Tax | FICA |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|------|
| **Accountable Plan** | Not taxable | Deductible | No FICA |
| **Non-Accountable Plan** | Taxable wages | Deductible | Subject to FICA |
| **Unreimbursed (post-TCJA)** | No deduction | N/A | N/A |
| **Salary increase instead** | Taxable wages | Deductible | Subject to FICA |

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Written Plan

- Timing requirements
- Return of excess procedure
- Advance policy (if applicable)

### Step 2: Establish Procedures

**Administrative setup:**
- Expense report forms
- Receipt submission process
- Approval workflow
- Reimbursement processing
- Record retention policy

### Step 3: Train Employees

**Communication:**
- What expenses are covered
- How to submit expenses
- Documentation requirements
- Deadlines for submission
- Consequences of non-compliance

### Step 4: Process Reimbursements

**Regular processing:**
- Review expense reports for business connection

- Approve appropriate expenses
- Process reimbursements promptly
- Track advances and returns

### Step 5: Maintain Records

**Employer should keep:**

## Special Situations

### S Corporation Shareholders (>2%)

**Special rules apply:**
- Health insurance premiums on W-2
- But accountable plan expenses NOT on W-2
- Important distinction from other fringe benefits

### Home Office for Employees

**Pre-2026 (TCJA):**
- Employees cannot deduct home office
- Employer can reimburse under accountable plan
- Must meet home office requirements
- Saves employee significant taxes

**Example:**
- Home office expenses: $5,000/year
- Without reimbursement: No deduction (TCJA)
- With accountable plan: $5,000 tax-free reimbursement

### Owner-Employees

**Considerations:**
- Must actually incur expenses
- Cannot reimburse phantom expenses
- Same substantiation requirements
- IRS scrutinizes more closely

### Independent Contractors

**NOT eligible for accountable plans:**
- Contractors are not employees
- Use different mechanisms:
  - Higher contract rate
  - Expense pass-through
  - Direct payment by client

## Risks & Considerations

### Non-Accountable Plan Treatment

**If requirements not met:**
- Reimbursements become taxable wages
- Subject to income tax withholding
- Subject to FICA
- Employer still gets deduction

### Common Failures

| Failure | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| No business connection | All reimbursements taxable |
| Poor substantiation | Unsubstantiated amounts taxable |
| No return of excess | Excess amounts taxable |
| Missing documentation | Audit risk |
| Excessive per diem | Excess taxable |

### Audit Risk Areas

**IRS focus points:**
- Lavish or extravagant expenses
- Personal expenses mixed with business
- Entertainment without business purpose
- Spousal travel without business need
- Vehicle expenses without mileage log
