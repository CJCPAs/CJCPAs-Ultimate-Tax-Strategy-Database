## Implementation Strategies

### Strategy 1: Separate Meals from Entertainment

**When hosting event with food:**
1. Get separate invoice for food/beverage
2. Or reasonably allocate costs
3. Document meal portion specifically
4. Deduct 50% of meal costs

### Strategy 2: Employee Recreation Events

**Maximize 100% deduction:**
- Holiday parties (invite all employees)
- Team celebrations
- Company picnics
- Milestone celebrations

**Keep client entertainment separate from employee events**

### Strategy 3: Working Meals

**During extended business meetings:**
- Order meals to continue meeting
- Document business purpose
- Meeting minutes showing work continued
- 50% deductible

### Strategy 4: Travel Meal Optimization

**Use per diem when advantageous:**
- Simplified record keeping
- May exceed actual costs
- Federal rates updated annually
- Track time and place only (no receipts needed for meals)

### Strategy 5: Business Gift Alternative

**Instead of non-deductible entertainment:**
- Give business gift (up to $25/person deductible)
- More cost-effective for small gestures
- Track per-recipient annually

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Documentation Failures

| Mistake | Risk |
|---------|------|
| No receipt | Deduction denied |
| Missing business purpose | IRS challenge |
| No attendee list | Cannot verify business relationship |
| Combining personal/business | Entire expense questioned |

### Classification Errors

| Mistake | Correct Treatment |
|---------|-------------------|
| Deducting entertainment at 50% | 0% deductible |
| Treating employee party as entertainment | 100% deductible (recreation) |
| Missing meal portion of entertainment | Separate and deduct 50% |

### Lavish or Extravagant

**Red Flags:**
- Fine dining for routine meetings
- Expensive wine/alcohol
- Multi-day luxury events

**IRS Scrutiny:**
- Extreme expenses relative to business size
