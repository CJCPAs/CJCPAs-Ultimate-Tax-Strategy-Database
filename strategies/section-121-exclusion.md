# Section 121 Primary Residence Exclusion

## Overview

IRC Section 121 allows homeowners to exclude up to $250,000 ($500,000 for married filing jointly) of capital gain from the sale of their primary residence. This exclusion can be used repeatedly (every two years) and represents one of the most valuable tax benefits available to individual taxpayers. With proper planning, taxpayers can maximize this benefit while avoiding common pitfalls.

## Effective Dates & Key Law Changes

| Provision | Current Law | 2026 and Beyond |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Single Exclusion | $250,000 | $250,000 (no change scheduled) |
| MFJ Exclusion | $500,000 | $500,000 (no change scheduled) |
| Ownership Test | 2 of 5 years | 2 of 5 years |
| Use Test | 2 of 5 years | 2 of 5 years |
| Frequency | Once every 2 years | Once every 2 years |
| Depreciation Recapture | Not excludable | Not excludable |

**Planning Note:** Section 121 was not affected by TCJA and has no sunset provision. However, state conformity varies.

## Key Benefits

- Exclude up to $250,000/$500,000 of capital gain
- No income limitations
- Can be used repeatedly every 2 years
- Partial exclusion for hardship situations
- Combines with other strategies (1031 conversion, etc.)
- Applies regardless of age (unlike old rollover rules)
- Gain doesn't count for Medicare IRMAA or other income tests

## Special Situations

### Partial Exclusion (Safe Harbor)

**If FULL tests not met, partial exclusion available for:**

1. **Employment Change**
   - New job location 50+ miles further
   - Applies to you, spouse, or co-owner

2. **Health Reasons**
   - Doctor-recommended move
   - Care for family member
   - Must be principal reason

3. **Unforeseen Circumstances**
   - Death
   - Divorce/legal separation
   - Multiple births from pregnancy
   - Job loss (unemployment compensation eligible)
   - Inability to pay housing costs
   - Natural/man-made disasters

**Partial Exclusion Calculation:**
```
Partial Exclusion = Full Exclusion × (Months Qualified / 24 Months)
```

**Example:**
- Sold after 15 months due to job relocation
- Single taxpayer
- Partial exclusion: $250,000 × (15/24) = $156,250

### Rental to Primary Residence Conversion

**Converting rental property:**
1. Move into rental property
2. Live as primary residence for 2+ years
3. Sell and claim Section 121 exclusion

**Depreciation Recapture Warning:**
- Depreciation claimed while rental is NOT excludable
- Taxed at 25% regardless of Section 121
- Plan accordingly

**Example:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Sale price | $800,000 |
| Original cost | $400,000 |
| Depreciation taken | $100,000 |
| Adjusted basis | $300,000 |
| Total gain | $500,000 |
| Depreciation recapture | $100,000 (25% = $25,000 tax) |
| Remaining gain | $400,000 |
| Section 121 exclusion | ($250,000) |
| **Taxable gain** | **$150,000** |

### Section 121 After 1031 Exchange

**Post-2008 Rules (Qualified Use):**

If property was acquired in 1031 exchange, special rules limit Section 121:
- Must own for 5 years after exchange
- Non-qualified use periods reduce exclusion
- Non-qualified use = periods property NOT used as residence

**Non-Qualified Use Ratio:**
```
Taxable Gain = Total Gain × (Non-Qualified Use / Total Ownership)
```

**Exception:** Non-qualified use AFTER residence period doesn't count

### Divorce Situations

**During Marriage:**
- Either spouse's ownership counts
- Both must meet use test for $500,000

**After Divorce (Incident to Divorce):**
- Transferee spouse counts transferor's ownership
- Can still claim exclusion if tests met
- Former spouse living in home may count for use

**Settlement Planning:**
- Consider who should get home
- Time sale for maximum exclusion
- Account for only one $250,000 exclusion

### Military Service Exception

**If couldn't live in home due to qualified official extended duty:**
- Suspend 5-year period for up to 10 years
- Effectively get 15-year lookback
- Applies to uniformed services members
- Must have used as residence before duty

### Deceased Taxpayer

**Sale by Estate:**
- Estate can claim exclusion if decedent met tests
- Must sell within 2 years of death (use test)
- Stepped-up basis may make exclusion unnecessary

**Surviving Spouse:**
- Can claim $500,000 if sell within 2 years of death
- Sale must occur in year of death or 2 years after
- After 2 years, limited to $250,000

## Advanced Strategies

### Strategy 1: Timing the Sale

**Wait for Full Qualification:**
- If close to 2 years, wait
- Calculate tax savings vs. market risk
- Document primary residence use

**Example:**
- 22 months of ownership/use
- $300,000 gain
- If sell now: $50,000 taxable (no exclusion)
- If wait 2 months: $0 taxable

### Strategy 2: Convert Second Home

**If have vacation home with appreciation:**
1. Make vacation home primary residence
2. Live there for 2+ years
3. Sell and claim Section 121
4. Repeat with another property

**Caution:** Non-qualified use rules apply to periods before residence

### Strategy 3: Married Filing Separately Strategy

**When MFS may help:**
- Only one spouse meets tests
- Each spouse has qualifying property
- State tax reasons

**Each spouse can claim $250,000 on their property**

### Strategy 4: Installment Sale for Excess Gain

**If gain exceeds exclusion:**
- Use Section 121 for excludable portion
- Installment sale for excess
- Spread taxable gain over years

**Example:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Total gain | $700,000 |
| Section 121 exclusion | ($500,000) |
| Taxable gain | $200,000 |
| Installment over 5 years | $40,000/year taxable |

### Strategy 5: Multiple Property Planning

**If own multiple residences:**
- Establish clear primary residence
- Document thoroughly
- Consider which to sell first
- Plan 2-year intervals

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Failing use test | No exclusion | Wait for 2 years |
| Selling twice in 2 years | Second sale not excluded | Time sales properly |
| Not documenting residence | IRS challenge | Keep records |
| Ignoring depreciation recapture | Unexpected tax | Calculate separately |
| Assuming MFJ automatic | May lose half exclusion | Both spouses must qualify |
| Missing partial exclusion | Pay full tax unnecessarily | Know safe harbor rules |
| 1031 to 121 without 5 years | Gain recognized | Wait 5 years |

## Case Study

### Scenario

Tom and Lisa, married, sell their home in 2026:
- Purchase price (2018): $600,000
- Sale price: $1,200,000
- Gain: $600,000
- Both lived in home 2018-2026 (8 years)
- Both on title

### Analysis

**Requirements Check:**
| Test | Tom | Lisa | Result |
|------|-----|------|--------|
| Ownership (2 of 5 years) | ✓ (8 years) | ✓ (8 years) | Met |
| Use (2 of 5 years) | ✓ (8 years) | ✓ (8 years) | Met |
| Frequency (no sale in 2 years) | ✓ | ✓ | Met |

**Exclusion Calculation:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Total gain | $600,000 |
| Section 121 exclusion (MFJ) | ($500,000) |
| **Taxable gain** | **$100,000** |

**Tax on $100,000:**
- Federal (20% + 3.8%): $23,800
- State (est. 5%): $5,000
- **Total tax: $28,800**

**Without Section 121:**
- Tax on $600,000: ~$172,800
- **Section 121 savings: $144,000**

### Complex Scenario: Former Rental

**Same couple, but:**
- Rented home 2018-2022 (4 years)
- Lived as residence 2022-2026 (4 years)
- Depreciation taken: $50,000

**Analysis:**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Total gain | $600,000 |
| Depreciation recapture | $50,000 (NOT excludable) |
| Remaining gain | $550,000 |

**Non-Qualified Use Calculation:**
- Total ownership: 8 years
- Non-qualified use (rental before residence): 4 years
- Ratio: 4/8 = 50%

**BUT:** Under IRS rules, rental use BEFORE residence period creates non-qualified use

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Remaining gain | $550,000 |
| Non-qualified use portion | $275,000 |
| Qualified use portion | $275,000 |
| Section 121 exclusion | ($275,000) |
| **Taxable (non-qualified)** | **$275,000** |
| Plus depreciation recapture | $50,000 |
| **Total taxable** | **$325,000** |
