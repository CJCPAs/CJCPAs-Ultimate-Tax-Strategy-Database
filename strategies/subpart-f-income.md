# Subpart F Income Planning

## Overview

Subpart F income represents certain categories of income earned by Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFCs) that must be included in U.S. shareholders' taxable income currently, regardless of whether the income is distributed. Enacted in 1962 to combat tax haven abuse, Subpart F rules target passive and mobile income types that could easily be shifted offshore to avoid U.S. taxation.

## Effective Dates & Key Law Changes

| Provision | Pre-TCJA (Before 2018) | Current Law (2018-2025) | 2026 and Beyond |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Subpart F Inclusion | Required | Required | Required |
| CFC Definition | >50% by 10%+ shareholders | >50% by 10%+ shareholders | Same |
| 30-Day Rule | Required | **Eliminated** | Eliminated |
| GILTI | N/A | Separate inclusion | Continues |
| PFIC Overlap | Complex | Complex | Same |
| Downward Attribution | Limited | **Expanded** | Continues |

**TCJA Changes:** Eliminated the 30-day minimum CFC holding period and expanded downward attribution from foreign persons, creating more CFCs.

### Foreign Personal Holding Company Income (FPHCI)

**Most Common Subpart F Category:**

| Income Type | Subpart F? | Exception |
|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Dividends from unrelated corp | Yes | Same country exception |
| Interest income | Yes | Active finance exception |
| Royalties | Yes | Active conduct exception |
| Rents | Yes | Active rents exception |
| Annuities | Yes | None |
| Capital gains (certain) | Yes | Active trade/business |
| Commodities gains | Yes | Hedging exception |
| Foreign currency gains | Yes | Business transactions |

### Foreign Base Company Sales Income

**When Related Party Sales Trigger Subpart F:**

| Scenario | Subpart F? |
|----------|------------|
| CFC buys from U.S. parent, sells to third party | Yes (generally) |
| CFC manufactures and sells | No (manufacturing exception) |
| CFC sells product manufactured in its country | No (same country exception) |
| CFC buys and sells in same country | No (same country exception) |
| CFC buys from third party, sells to related party | Yes (generally) |

### Foreign Base Company Services Income

**Services Income Subject to Subpart F:**
1. Services performed FOR related party
2. Services performed ON BEHALF OF related party
3. Services performed OUTSIDE CFC's country of organization

**Example:**
- U.S. parent has Irish subsidiary
- Irish subsidiary provides consulting to German affiliate
- Services performed in Germany
- = Subpart F services income

## Requirements

### Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC)

**Definition:**
- Foreign corporation
- U.S. shareholders own >50% of vote OR value
- Only count 10%+ shareholders for this test

**After TCJA:**
- Downward attribution from foreign persons
- More companies now CFCs
- Review all foreign structures

### U.S. Shareholder

**Definition:**
- U.S. person
- Owns 10%+ of vote OR value
- Direct, indirect, or constructive ownership

### Inclusion Mechanics

**Pro Rata Share:**
- Based on ownership percentage
- On last day of CFC's year (or last day as CFC)
- Even if no distribution

**Basis Adjustment:**
- Increase basis for Subpart F inclusion
- Prevent double taxation on distribution
- Track previously taxed earnings (PTEP)

## De Minimis and Full Inclusion Rules

### De Minimis Rule

**If Subpart F income < LESSER of:**
- 5% of gross income, OR
- $1,000,000

**Then:** No Subpart F inclusion

### Full Inclusion Rule

**If Subpart F income > 70% of gross income:**

**Then:** ALL gross income is Subpart F income

### Planning Implications

| Subpart F % of Gross | Treatment |
|---------------------|-----------|
| < De minimis | No inclusion |
| De minimis to 70% | Include only Subpart F |
| > 70% | ALL income is Subpart F |

**Goal:** Stay below de minimis OR avoid 70%+ threshold

## Client Fit Criteria

### Who Faces Subpart F Issues?

| Situation | Subpart F Risk |
|-----------|----------------|
| U.S. owns foreign holding company | High (FPHCI) |
| Foreign subsidiary in tax haven | High (base company) |
| Transfer pricing arrangements | Moderate to High |
| Foreign services company | Moderate |
| Foreign manufacturing (unrelated) | Lower |
| Passive foreign investments | Usually PFIC, not CFC |

### Red Flags for Subpart F

| Indicator | Concern |
|-----------|---------|
| Foreign subsidiary earns interest/dividends | FPHCI |
| Buy-sell arrangements through foreign entity | Sales income |
| Foreign entity provides services to affiliates | Services income |
| Intellectual property in low-tax jurisdiction | Royalty income |
| Captive insurance offshore | Insurance income |

## Planning Strategies

### Strategy 1: Same Country Exception (Sales)

**For Foreign Base Company Sales Income:**
- Property manufactured in CFC's country, OR
- Property sold for use in CFC's country

**Structure to qualify:**
- Locate manufacturing in CFC jurisdiction
- Sell into CFC's market
- Document business purpose

### Strategy 2: Manufacturing Exception

**Substantial transformation = No Subpart F:**
- CFC manufactures the product
- Creates substantial value
- Not mere assembly

**Contract Manufacturing:**
- May qualify if CFC controls manufacturing
- Recent regulations clarify
- Document involvement

### Strategy 3: Active Rents and Royalties Exception

**Active Business Exception:**
| Income Type | Exception Requirements |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Rents | CFC active in rental business |
| Royalties | CFC active in developing IP |

**Requirements:**
- Substantial activities
- Employees performing functions
- Not passive licensing

### Strategy 4: Same Country Exception (FPHCI)

**Dividends/Interest from Same Country Payors:**
- Payor organized in same country as CFC
- Payor has substantial part of assets in country
- May exclude from FPHCI

### Strategy 5: Check-the-Box Elections

**Entity Classification:**
- Elect foreign subsidiary as disregarded
- Consolidate with parent CFC
- May eliminate intercompany Subpart F

**Example:**
- U.S. parent owns CFC 1 (operating) and CFC 2 (holding)
- CFC 2 receives dividends from CFC 1
- Elect CFC 2 as disregarded → No FPHCI

### Strategy 6: High-Tax Exception

**If CFC Income Taxed at High Rate:**
- Effective rate > 90% of U.S. max rate (33.3%)
- May elect to exclude from Subpart F
- Different from GILTI high-tax exclusion

### Strategy 7: De Minimis Planning

**Keep Subpart F Below Threshold:**
- Monitor Subpart F categories
- Time transactions
- Structure to avoid crossing threshold

## Subpart F vs. GILTI Interaction

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Subpart F | GILTI |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Income Types | Passive, base company | Active (residual) |
| Priority | First | After Subpart F |
| QBAI Exclusion | No | Yes (10%) |
| Section 250 | No | Yes (corporations) |
| FTC Basket | General | GILTI basket |

### Ordering Rules

1. **Calculate Subpart F income**
2. **Exclude Subpart F from tested income (GILTI)**
3. **Calculate GILTI on remaining tested income**
4. **Both included in shareholder's income**

### Example

| CFC Income | Amount | Classification |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| Total earnings | $2,000,000 | |
| Interest income (FPHCI) | $500,000 | Subpart F |
| Active business | $1,500,000 | Tested income |
| QBAI return (10% × $5M) | ($500,000) | |
| **GILTI** | **$1,000,000** | |
| **Total Inclusion** | **$1,500,000** | |

## Tax Compliance

### Reporting Requirements

| Form | Purpose | Penalty |
|------|---------|---------|
| Form 5471 | CFC information | $10,000+ |
| Schedule E (5471) | Income statement | Included |
| Schedule I (5471) | Subpart F summary | Included |
| Schedule J (5471) | E&P tracking | Included |
| Schedule P (5471) | PTEP tracking | Included |
| Form 8992 | GILTI (separate) | With return |

### Previously Taxed Earnings and Profits (PTEP)

**Track Subpart F inclusions:**
- Basis increased for inclusions
- Distributions from PTEP tax-free
- Multiple PTEP categories post-TCJA
- Complex ordering rules

## Case Study

### Scenario

TechCorp (U.S.) owns:
- DevCo (Ireland) - Software development
- HoldCo (Cayman) - Holds IP, receives royalties

**HoldCo (Cayman) Income:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Royalties from DevCo | $5,000,000 |
| Interest from bank | $100,000 |
| Foreign tax | $50,000 |
| **Gross Income** | **$5,100,000** |

### Analysis

**Subpart F Classification:**
| Income | Category | Subpart F? |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Royalties | FPHCI | Yes |
| Interest | FPHCI | Yes |
| **Total Subpart F** | | **$5,100,000** |

**Full Inclusion Test:**
- Subpart F: $5,100,000
- Gross income: $5,100,000
- Ratio: 100% (>70%)
- **All income is Subpart F**

### U.S. Tax Impact

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Subpart F inclusion | $5,100,000 |
| TechCorp rate | 21% |
| Gross tax | $1,071,000 |
| Foreign tax credit | $50,000 |
| **Net U.S. tax** | **$1,021,000** |

### Planning Alternatives

**Option 1: Check-the-Box**
- Elect HoldCo as disregarded
- Royalties become DevCo income (active)
- DevCo pays higher Irish tax but avoids Subpart F

**Option 2: Substance in HoldCo**
- Add employees, activities to HoldCo
- Develop IP actively
- May qualify for active royalty exception

**Option 3: Restructure IP**
- License IP directly from U.S.
- Deduct royalty in DevCo
- U.S. income offset by deduction analysis

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Ignoring FPHCI | Unexpected inclusion | Track all passive income |
| Missing same country exception | Overstated Subpart F | Proper analysis |
| Not tracking PTEP | Double taxation | Maintain records |
| Failing to file Form 5471 | $10,000+ penalties | Timely compliance |
| Overlooking related party rules | Sales/services income | Map all intercompany |
| Wrong entity classification | CFC status | Review check-the-box |
