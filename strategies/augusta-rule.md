# Augusta Rule (Section 280A)

## Overview

The Augusta Rule, named after the Masters golf tournament practice of homeowners renting their homes during the event, allows individuals to rent their personal residence for up to 14 days per year and exclude all rental income from taxation. This strategy enables business owners to rent their homes to their businesses for meetings and events, creating a business deduction while generating tax-free personal income.

## Key Benefits

- Up to 14 days of tax-free rental income annually
- No limitation on amount of daily rental rate (must be reasonable)
- Creates business deduction for the company
- No reporting requirement on personal return
- Legitimate tax arbitrage opportunity

## How It Works

### The Tax Arbitrage
1. Business pays fair market rent to business owner for use of home
2. Business receives tax deduction for rent expense
3. Owner receives rental income tax-free (up to 14 days)
4. **Result**: Deduction created without corresponding taxable income

### Example
- Business owner rents home to S Corp for 12 board meetings
- Fair market daily rental rate: $2,500/day
- Annual rental income: $30,000
- Tax-free to owner (Section 280A exclusion)
- $30,000 deduction to S Corp
- At 37% tax rate: **$11,100 in tax savings**

## Requirements

### 14-Day Rule Requirements
- Rental cannot exceed 14 days per calendar year
- Property must be personal residence
- Rental must be at arm's length fair market value
- Legitimate business purpose required

### Documentation Requirements
- **Board resolutions** authorizing location use
- **Rental agreement** between owner and business
- **Fair market value analysis** supporting rental rate
- **Meeting minutes** documenting business purpose
- **Attendance records** for each event
- **Invoices and payment records**

### Fair Market Value Substantiation
- Comparable venue rental rates
- Written quote from comparable facilities
- Consider included amenities
- Professional appraisal (recommended for higher amounts)
- Online comparable analysis

## Client Fit Criteria

### Ideal Candidates
- Business owners with homes suitable for meetings
- Companies holding regular board or shareholder meetings
- Businesses that host client events or training
- Owners with upscale homes (higher FMV rental)
- S corporations and partnerships

### Good Candidates
- Professional practices holding partner meetings
- Family businesses with annual meetings
- Companies needing occasional off-site venues
- Businesses with employee training events

### Less Suitable
- Businesses with few legitimate meeting needs
- Very small or modest residences
- Owners in low tax brackets
- Businesses already using home office deduction extensively

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Determine Eligibility

1. **Assess Business Needs**
   - Identify meetings/events requiring venue
   - Estimate number of meeting days needed
   - Confirm meetings have legitimate business purpose

2. **Evaluate Residence**
   - Confirm property qualifies as personal residence
   - Assess suitability for business events
   - Identify comparable commercial venues

### Step 2: Establish Fair Market Value

1. **Research Comparable Venues**
   - Hotel meeting rooms
   - Conference centers
   - Country clubs
   - Executive suites
   - Event venues

2. **Document Comparison**
   - Obtain written quotes from 2-3 venues
   - Note included amenities at each
   - Adjust for comparable features
   - Consider location and convenience

3. **Determine Rental Rate**
   - Rate should be supportable if audited
   - Include value of parking, catering space
   - Consider technology/AV equipment included
   - Document methodology

### Step 3: Create Legal Framework

1. **Corporate Authorization**
   - Board resolution authorizing use of home for meetings
   - Resolution should specify business purpose
   - Authorize officers to execute rental agreement

2. **Rental Agreement**
   - Written agreement between owner and business
   - Specify dates, duration, rental rate
   - Include terms and conditions
   - Both parties sign

3. **Usage Policy**
   - Document when home may be used
   - Specify eligible events
   - Establish booking procedures

### Step 4: Execute and Document Each Use

1. **Before Each Event**
   - Confirm date doesn't exceed 14-day limit
   - Prepare agenda and purpose documentation
   - Notify participants of location

2. **During Event**
   - Take photos of setup (optional but helpful)
   - Maintain attendance sign-in sheet
   - Keep agenda and meeting materials

3. **After Event**
   - Prepare meeting minutes
   - Issue invoice from owner to business
   - Process payment (actual funds must transfer)
   - File documentation

### Step 5: Annual Compliance

1. **Track Day Count**
   - Maintain calendar of all uses
   - Ensure 14-day limit not exceeded
   - Count partial days appropriately

2. **Annual FMV Review**
   - Update comparable analysis annually
   - Adjust rate if market changes
   - Document any rate changes

3. **Tax Reporting**
   - Business deducts rent expense
   - Owner does NOT report income on personal return
   - No Form 1099 required

## Risks & Considerations

### Audit Risk Factors
- **Unreasonable rates**: Excessive FMV most common issue
- **Lack of documentation**: No business purpose evidence
- **No substance**: Meetings not actually held
- **Related party scrutiny**: Higher audit risk for self-dealing

### Compliance Pitfalls
- Exceeding 14-day limit (becomes taxable rental)
- Mixing personal and business use
- Failing to document business purpose
- Not actually transferring funds

### Best Practices for Audit Defense
- Keep contemporaneous records
- Have third parties present at meetings
- Maintain detailed agendas and minutes
- Use written, signed agreements
- Pay via check or documented transfer
- Retain all supporting documents

- Home office deduction may be impacted
- Mortgage interest allocation
- Property tax considerations
- Insurance implications
