# Section 83(b) Elections

## Overview

A Section 83(b) election allows recipients of restricted stock (not RSUs) to recognize taxable income at the time of grant rather than waiting until the stock vests. By electing to pay tax on the lower grant-date value, all future appreciation can be converted from ordinary income to long-term capital gains. This is one of the most powerful—and time-sensitive—tax planning tools for startup equity.

## Key Benefits

- Convert future ordinary income to long-term capital gains
- Pay tax on lower value at grant (before appreciation)
- Start long-term capital gains holding period immediately
- Potentially significant tax savings on appreciated stock
- Qualify for QSBS exclusion from grant date
- Lock in low valuation at early-stage companies

## How Section 83(b) Works

## Tax Comparison Example

**Scenario**: 100,000 shares of restricted stock
- Grant value: $0.10/share
- Vesting value (4 years): $10.00/share
- Sale value (5 years): $50.00/share
- Tax rates: 37% ordinary, 23.8% LTCG

### Without 83(b) Election

| Event | Calculation | Tax |
|-------|-------------|----:|
| Grant | No tax | $0 |
| Vesting | 100,000 × ($10 - $0.10) × 37% | $366,300 |
| Sale | 100,000 × ($50 - $10) × 23.8% | $952,000 |
| **Total Tax** | | **$1,318,300** |

### With 83(b) Election

| Event | Calculation | Tax |
|-------|-------------|----:|
| Grant | 100,000 × $0.10 × 37% | $3,700 |
| Vesting | No tax (already recognized) | $0 |
| Sale | 100,000 × ($50 - $0.10) × 23.8% | $1,187,620 |
| **Total Tax** | | **$1,191,320** |

### Tax Savings: $126,980

| Day | Action Required |
|-----|-----------------|
| Day 0 | Stock granted |
| Day 1-30 | File 83(b) with IRS |

## Client Fit Criteria

### Ideal Candidates
- Early-stage startup employees/founders
- Recipients of stock with low current FMV
- Those confident stock will appreciate
- Individuals who can afford to pay tax upfront
- Those who can tolerate risk of forfeiture
- QSBS-eligible company participants

### Risk Assessment Questions

| Question | Favorable for 83(b) |
|----------|---------------------|
| Is current FMV very low? | Yes |
| High confidence in appreciation? | Yes |
| Can afford upfront tax? | Yes |
| Low risk of forfeiture? | Yes |
| Planning to stay through vesting? | Yes |
| QSBS eligibility? | Yes (starts holding period) |

### Less Ideal Candidates
- Those receiving stock at high current value
- Uncertain about company's future
- High risk of leaving before vesting
- Cannot afford upfront tax payment
- Stock already substantially vested

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Receive Restricted Stock Grant

**Document:**
- Grant date
- Number of shares
- Vesting schedule
- Current FMV (409A valuation for private companies)
- Restrictions and forfeiture provisions

### Step 2: Evaluate 83(b) Decision

**Analysis Checklist:**
- [ ] Current FMV of stock
- [ ] Expected future appreciation
- [ ] Probability of forfeiture
- [ ] Tax cost of election
- [ ] QSBS qualification potential
- [ ] Risk tolerance

**Decision Framework:**

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Very low FMV, high growth expected | Strongly consider 83(b) |
| Moderate FMV, uncertain growth | Evaluate carefully |
| High FMV, unknown trajectory | Generally avoid 83(b) |
| High forfeiture risk | Generally avoid 83(b) |

### Step 3: File Election (If Decided)

**Timeline:**
| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Day 1-5 | Make decision |
| Day 5-10 | Prepare election document |
| Day 10-15 | Sign and mail to IRS |
| Day 15-20 | Deliver copy to employer |
| Day 20-25 | Confirm receipt |

**Filing Method:**
- Certified mail, return receipt requested (recommended)
- Keep proof of mailing
- Keep copy of signed election

### Step 4: Record Keeping

**Maintain:**
- Copy of signed election
- Proof of filing (certified mail receipt)
- Copy provided to employer
- 409A valuation supporting FMV
- Vesting schedule documentation
- Copy attached to tax return

## QSBS Integration

### Why 83(b) + QSBS is Powerful

**Section 1202 QSBS Requirements:**
- C corporation stock
- Held more than 5 years
- Active business requirement
- $50 million gross assets limit

**83(b) Benefit**: Holding period starts at GRANT, not vesting

**Without 83(b):**
- Grant: Year 0
- Vesting: Year 4
- QSBS 5-year clock starts: Year 4
- QSBS eligible: Year 9

**With 83(b):**
- Grant: Year 0
- 83(b) election: Day 30
- QSBS 5-year clock starts: Year 0
- QSBS eligible: Year 5

### QSBS Tax Savings

| Gain | Federal Tax (without QSBS) | Federal Tax (with QSBS) |
|------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| $1,000,000 | $238,000 | $0 |
| $5,000,000 | $1,190,000 | $0 |
| $10,000,000 | $2,380,000 | $0 |

*Assumes 100% QSBS exclusion and gain within exclusion limits*

## Risks & Considerations

### Forfeiture Risk (Primary Concern)

**The Big Risk**: If you file 83(b), pay tax, then forfeit the stock, you:
- Lose the stock
- Lose the tax paid
- Get NO deduction for the loss (except capital loss on amount paid)

**Mitigation:**
- Assess forfeiture probability honestly
- Consider company stability
- Evaluate personal circumstances
- Only elect if confident in staying

### Valuation Risk

**Issue**: 409A valuation may be higher than expected

**Impact**: Higher upfront tax if FMV is elevated

**Mitigation:**
- Obtain grants shortly after 409A valuation
- Understand valuation methodology
- Consider timing around funding rounds

### Company-Specific Risks

| Risk | Description | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Company failure | Stock becomes worthless | Only capital loss available |
| Down round | Stock value decreases | May have overpaid tax |
| Acquisition | Terms may change | Usually still beneficial |
| IPO delay | Liquidity timing uncertain | No tax impact |

### Deadline Risk

**CANNOT BE OVERSTATED**: Missing the 30-day deadline is irreversible

**Best Practices:**
- Calendar the deadline immediately
- Set multiple reminders
- Use certified mail early in the window
- Do not wait until day 30

### AMT Consideration

- 83(b) income may create or increase AMT
- AMT exemption phases out at high income
- Calculate AMT impact before electing
- Consider partial elections if possible

## Case Study

### Scenario
Sarah joins a Series A startup as VP of Engineering. She receives:
- 200,000 shares of restricted common stock
- 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff
- Current 409A value: $0.50/share
- Exercise price: $0.001/share (effectively zero)

### Analysis

**Current Tax Cost of 83(b):**
- FMV: $0.50/share
- Shares: 200,000
- Taxable income: $100,000
- Tax (40% combined): $40,000

**Projected Scenarios:**

| Exit Value | Without 83(b) Tax | With 83(b) Tax | Savings |
|------------|-------------------|----------------|---------|
| $5/share | $318,000 | $228,000 | $90,000 |
| $10/share | $638,000 | $468,000 | $170,000 |
| $50/share | $3,358,000 | $2,388,000 | $970,000 |
| Failure ($0) | $0 | $40,000 | ($40,000) |

### Decision Factors

**Favoring 83(b):**
- Low current value ($0.50)
- Strong growth potential (Series A)
- Long-term commitment planned
- QSBS holding period starts now
- Potential for massive appreciation

**Against 83(b):**
- $40,000 upfront cash required
- Startup risk (many fail)
- 4-year vesting commitment

### Recommendation

**FILE 83(b)** because:
1. Upfront cost ($40,000) is manageable
2. Potential savings ($170,000-$970,000+) are significant
3. QSBS clock starts immediately
4. She's committed to the role
5. Even at modest exit ($5/share), saves $90,000

### If Stock Becomes Worthless

| Item | Amount |
|------|-------:|
| Tax paid | $40,000 |
| Capital loss (cost basis $200) | $200 |
| Net loss | $39,800 |

This is the maximum downside—equivalent to "insurance premium" for tax savings.

## Early Exercise of Stock Options

### Related Strategy

Some stock option plans allow early exercise (exercising unvested options). This creates restricted stock eligible for 83(b) election.

**Early Exercise + 83(b) Combination:**
1. Exercise unvested options
2. Receive restricted stock
3. File 83(b) within 30 days
4. Pay tax on spread (often $0 if FMV = exercise price)
5. Start LTCG and QSBS holding periods

**Benefits:**
- Same as 83(b) for restricted stock
- Converts option spread to capital gains
- Starts QSBS clock early

**Requirements:**
- Plan must permit early exercise
- Must file 83(b) election
- Company must offer this feature
