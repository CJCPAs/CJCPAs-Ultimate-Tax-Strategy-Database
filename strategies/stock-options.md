# Stock Options: ISOs vs. NQSOs

## Overview

Stock options are a common form of equity compensation that give employees the right to purchase company stock at a predetermined price (exercise price or strike price). The two primary types—Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) and Non-Qualified Stock Options (NQSOs)—have dramatically different tax consequences. Understanding these differences is critical for optimizing after-tax outcomes.

## Key Benefits

- Participate in company growth with limited downside risk
- Defer taxation until exercise (or later for ISOs)
- Potential for long-term capital gains treatment (ISOs)
- No cash outlay until exercise decision
- Alignment of employee and shareholder interests
- Flexibility in timing of exercise and sale

## ISO vs. NQSO Comparison

| Feature | ISO | NQSO |
|---------|-----|------|
| Tax at grant | None | None |
| Tax at exercise | None (but AMT preference) | Ordinary income on spread |
| Tax at sale | Capital gains (if qualified) | Capital gains on post-exercise gain |
| Employer deduction | None | Yes, at exercise |
| Holding requirements | Yes (1 year + 2 years) | None |
| AMT impact | Yes | No |
| Annual limit | $100,000 vesting limit | None |
| Eligibility | Employees only | Employees, contractors, directors |
| Transferability | Generally not transferable | May be transferable |

## Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)

### Tax Treatment

**At Grant:**
- No taxable event
- No income reported
- FMV must equal exercise price

**At Exercise:**
- No regular income tax
- AMT preference item = Spread (FMV - Exercise Price)
- May trigger AMT liability
- Holding period begins

**At Sale (Qualifying Disposition):**
- Must hold 2+ years from grant AND 1+ year from exercise
- Entire gain is long-term capital gain
- Maximum rate: 20% + 3.8% NIIT = 23.8%

**At Sale (Disqualifying Disposition):**
- Fails holding period requirements
- Spread at exercise = ordinary income
- Additional gain = capital gain
- Employer gets deduction

### ISO Limits

**$100,000 Rule:**
- Maximum $100,000 worth of ISOs can vest in any calendar year
- Based on FMV at grant date
- Excess treated as NQSOs
- Calculated per company

**Example:**
- Grant: 10,000 ISOs at $15 strike, 4-year vest
- Annual vesting: 2,500 shares
- Value vesting per year: $37,500
- All shares qualify as ISOs (under $100,000)

### AMT Calculation at Exercise

| Item | Amount |
|------|-------:|
| ISO exercise: 1,000 shares | |
| Exercise price | $10 |
| FMV at exercise | $50 |
| Spread | $40 |
| AMT preference | $40,000 |
| AMT rate | 26-28% |
| Potential AMT | $10,400-$11,200 |

### ISO Strategies

**1. Exercise and Hold (For Qualified Disposition)**
- Exercise options
- Hold for required period
- Pay AMT in exercise year
- Recover AMT as credit in sale year
- Best when confident in stock appreciation

**2. Same-Day Sale (Disqualifying Disposition)**
- Exercise and sell immediately
- Ordinary income on spread
- No holding period risk
- No AMT (income is regular income)
- Best when stock may decline or need liquidity

**3. Exercise and Sell Enough to Cover AMT**
- Exercise all shares
- Sell portion to cover AMT
- Hold remainder for LTCG
- Partial disqualification on sold shares
- Balances tax optimization with risk management

**4. AMT Credit Recovery Planning**
- AMT paid becomes credit for future years
- Credit recovered when regular tax exceeds AMT
- May take multiple years to fully recover
- Model multi-year scenarios

## Non-Qualified Stock Options (NQSOs)

### Tax Treatment

**At Grant:**
- Generally no taxable event
- Unless option has readily ascertainable FMV (rare)

**At Exercise:**
- Ordinary income = FMV - Exercise Price
- Subject to income tax withholding
- Subject to FICA taxes (up to wage base)
- Employer gets deduction
- Reported on W-2 or 1099

**At Sale:**
- Capital gain/loss on difference from exercise FMV
- Short-term if held < 1 year
- Long-term if held > 1 year
- Basis = FMV at exercise

### NQSO Strategies

**1. Exercise Early in Low-Income Years**
- Lower marginal tax bracket
- State tax considerations
- Retirement, sabbatical, job transition
- Spread recognized as ordinary income

**2. Defer Exercise to Manage Brackets**
- Avoid pushing into higher brackets
- Spread exercises across years
- Consider state tax thresholds
- AMT not a factor

**3. Charitable Giving with NQSOs**
- Cannot donate options directly
- Exercise, hold, then donate stock
- Avoid capital gains on donated shares
- Deduct FMV at donation

**4. Net Exercise (If Permitted)**
- Company withholds shares to cover costs
- Reduces cash outlay
- Same tax treatment as regular exercise
- Check if plan allows

## Exercise Timing Considerations

### Factors Favoring Early Exercise

| Factor | Reasoning |
|--------|-----------|
| Low current spread | Minimize ordinary income (NQSO) or AMT (ISO) |
| High growth expected | More gain taxed as LTCG |
| Low current income | Lower marginal rate |
| Leaving company | May have limited exercise window |
| 83(b) election available | Lock in low value (restricted stock only) |

### Factors Favoring Delayed Exercise

| Factor | Reasoning |
|--------|-----------|
| Stock uncertainty | Avoid paying tax on declining stock |
| Liquidity constraints | No cash for exercise price/taxes |
| High current income | Avoid adding to already-taxed income |
| AMT exposure (ISOs) | Spread current AMT preference |
| Option time value | Retain optionality |

## Requirements

### ISO Requirements (IRC Section 422)
- Granted under shareholder-approved plan
- Exercise price ≥ FMV at grant
- 10-year maximum term
- Employee of granting company (or subsidiary)
- No transfer except at death
- Exercise within 3 months of termination (12 months for disability)

### NQSO Requirements
- Must comply with Section 409A
- Exercise price ≥ FMV at grant (safe harbor)
- Proper valuation documentation
- Avoid deferred compensation treatment

## Client Fit Criteria

### ISO Planning Candidates
- Employees with significant ISO grants
- Those with AMT planning opportunities
- Long-term believers in company stock
- Individuals with liquidity for exercise
- Those in high ordinary income brackets

### NQSO Planning Candidates
- Executives with large NQSO grants
- Contractors and directors (ISOs not available)
- Those wanting certainty (no AMT complexity)
- Individuals with variable income years
- Charitable giving plans

## Implementation Steps

### ISO Exercise Strategy

1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Calculate AMT exposure at various exercise levels
   - Project stock appreciation
   - Assess holding period risk
   - Model qualified vs. disqualifying outcomes

2. **AMT Planning**
   - Calculate AMT "crossover point"
   - Exercise up to crossover without triggering AMT
   - Consider state AMT
   - Plan for AMT credit recovery

3. **Execution**
   - Document exercise date (for holding period)
   - Track cost basis carefully
   - Calculate AMT preference for Form 6251
   - Consider estimated tax payments

4. **Post-Exercise Monitoring**
   - Track holding periods
   - Evaluate sell decisions
   - Monitor AMT credit carryforward
   - Consider hedging strategies

### NQSO Exercise Strategy

1. **Income Projection**
   - Calculate marginal tax rate at various exercise levels
   - Consider federal and state rates
   - Account for phase-outs and surtaxes
   - Model multi-year scenarios

2. **Timing Optimization**
   - Identify low-income years
   - Consider approaching expiration
   - Evaluate company liquidity events
   - Plan around life events (retirement, etc.)

3. **Execution**
   - Coordinate with employer on withholding
   - Consider net exercise if available
   - Document basis for future sales
   - File appropriate tax forms

## Risks & Considerations

### ISO Risks
- **AMT trap**: Exercise creates phantom income for AMT
- **Stock decline**: Paid AMT but stock worth less
- **Disqualification**: Inadvertent failure of holding period
- **Concentration risk**: Too much wealth in one stock
- **Expiration**: ISOs must be exercised within 10 years

### NQSO Risks
- **Withholding**: May be insufficient (especially state)
- **Timing**: Exercise in wrong year increases taxes
- **Expiration**: Options worthless if stock below strike
- **409A issues**: Improper valuation can cause penalties
- **Golden handcuffs**: May feel trapped by unvested options

### General Risks
- **Company stock concentration**: Diversification concerns
- **Liquidity**: May not be able to sell (private company)
- **Black-out periods**: Trading restrictions
- **10b5-1 plans**: Needed for insiders

## Case Study

### Scenario
Jennifer, a tech executive, has the following option grants:

**ISOs:**
- 10,000 shares, $20 strike, current FMV $80
- Granted 3 years ago
- All vested

**NQSOs:**
- 20,000 shares, $25 strike, current FMV $80
- Granted 2 years ago
- All vested

Current income: $400,000 (32% federal bracket, approaching 35%)

### Analysis

**ISO Exercise Analysis:**

| Scenario | Spread | AMT Preference | Estimated AMT |
|----------|-------:|---------------:|--------------:|
| Exercise 2,500 ISOs | $150,000 | $150,000 | ~$18,000 |
| Exercise 5,000 ISOs | $300,000 | $300,000 | ~$60,000 |
| Exercise all 10,000 | $600,000 | $600,000 | ~$140,000 |

**NQSO Exercise Analysis:**

| Scenario | Spread | Ordinary Income | Tax (est. 40%) |
|----------|-------:|----------------:|---------------:|
| Exercise 5,000 NQSOs | $275,000 | $275,000 | $110,000 |
| Exercise 10,000 NQSOs | $550,000 | $550,000 | $220,000 |
| Exercise all 20,000 | $1,100,000 | $1,100,000 | $440,000 |

### Recommended Strategy

**Year 1:**
- Exercise 5,000 ISOs (manageable AMT, start holding period)
- Exercise 5,000 NQSOs (stay in 35% bracket)
- Total income increase: ~$275,000 (NQSO spread)
- AMT on ISOs: ~$30,000

**Year 2:**
- Exercise remaining 5,000 ISOs
- Exercise 10,000 NQSOs
- Consider selling Year 1 ISOs (qualifying disposition)

**Year 3:**
- Exercise remaining 5,000 NQSOs
- Sell Year 1 ISOs (LTCG treatment)
- Recover AMT credits

### Projected Outcome (if stock stays at $80)

| Item | Tax-Naive Approach | Optimized Approach |
|------|-------------------:|-------------------:|
| Total federal tax | ~$800,000 | ~$680,000 |
| Capital gains treatment | Minimal | Significant (ISOs) |
| AMT recovery | None | Full |
| **Tax savings** | — | **~$120,000** |
