# Opportunity Zones

## Overview

Qualified Opportunity Zones (QOZs) were created by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 to encourage long-term investment in economically distressed communities. Investors can defer and reduce capital gains taxes by investing those gains into Qualified Opportunity Funds (QOFs), with the potential for tax-free appreciation if held long enough.

## Key Benefits

- **Deferral**: Defer recognition of capital gains until 2026 (or earlier sale)
- **Reduction**: No step-up in basis remaining after 2026 (previously 10% at 5 years, 15% at 7 years)
- **Exclusion**: Exclude 100% of appreciation on QOF investment held 10+ years
- Geographic flexibility with 8,700+ designated zones

## Tax Benefit Summary

| Benefit | Requirement | Status (2026) |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Gain Deferral | Invest gain in QOF | **Ends 12/31/2026** - All deferred gains recognized |
| 10% Basis Step-up | 5-year hold | Expired (needed investment by 12/31/2019) |
| 15% Basis Step-up | 7-year hold | Expired (needed investment by 12/31/2017) |
| Exclusion of QOF Appreciation | 10-year hold | Available through 2047 (for 2026 investments held 10+ years) |

## Effective Dates

| Provision | Effective Date | Expiration |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| QOZ Designation | Tax Cuts and Jobs Act December 22, 2017 | Zone designations through 2028 (most zones) |

| 10-Year Appreciation Exclusion | 10-year hold from investment | Active - Available for investments held through 2036+ |

**2026 Tax Year - Critical Dates**:
- **December 31, 2026**: ALL deferred gains from QOF investments will be recognized and taxable. Plan for this significant tax liability.
- New investments in 2026 still qualify for the 10-year appreciation exclusion (gains excluded if held until 2036+).
- No basis step-up benefits remain available for new investments.
- QOZ investing in 2026 primarily provides appreciation exclusion benefit only.

## Case Study

### Scenario
Investor sells appreciated stock for $2,000,000 gain in 2024. Invests $2,000,000 in self-created QOF that develops multifamily housing in qualified zone.

### Timeline

**2024**
- Recognize $2,000,000 capital gain
- Invest $2,000,000 in QOF within 180 days
- Defer recognition of gain

**2024-2026**
- QOF develops multifamily property
- Property appreciates to $3,000,000

**December 31, 2026**
- Deferred gain of $2,000,000 recognized
- No basis step-up (expired)
- Tax due on original $2,000,000 gain

**2034 (10-year hold)**
- QOF value: $5,000,000
- Elect basis step-up to FMV
- Appreciation of $3,000,000 ($5M - $2M) excluded
- Tax savings on appreciation: $3,000,000 × 23.8% = **$714,000**

### Net Benefit Analysis

| Item | Amount |
|------|-------:|
| Original gain | $2,000,000 |
| Deferral benefit (NPV) | ~$150,000 |
| Excluded appreciation | $3,000,000 |
