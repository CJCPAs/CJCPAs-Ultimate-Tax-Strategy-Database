# Defined Benefit Plans

## Overview

Defined Benefit (DB) plans allow substantially higher tax-deductible contributions than other retirement plans—potentially over $250,000 annually. Unlike 401(k)s where contributions are limited, DB plans promise a specific retirement benefit, with contributions actuarially determined based on age, income, and years until retirement. This makes them ideal for high-income business owners over 50.

## Key Benefits

- Contributions of $200,000-$350,000+ annually possible
- Maximum benefit: $290,000/year at retirement (2026 projected, indexed for inflation)
- Larger deductions than any other qualified plan
- Tax-deferred growth on substantial amounts
- Creditor protection under ERISA
- Catch-up for late starters

## DB Plan vs. Other Plans Comparison

| Plan Type | Max Annual Contribution | Best Age Group |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------|
| Traditional 401(k) | $23,500 ($31,000 if 50+) (2026 projected) | All ages |
| Solo 401(k) | $70,000 ($77,500 if 50+) (2026 projected) | All ages |
| SEP IRA | $70,000 (2026 projected) | All ages |
| Defined Benefit | $200,000-$350,000+ | 50+ years old |

*Note: 2026 contribution limits are projections based on inflation indexing. Final limits announced by IRS.*

   - Early retirement provisions
   - Integration with Social Security

3. **Coverage Testing**
   - Run coverage and discrimination tests
   - Model employee costs
   - Design to minimize employee contributions while passing tests

   - PBGC premiums if applicable

2. **Compliance Monitoring**
   - Annual coverage testing
   - Top-heavy determination
   - Benefit limit compliance
   - Required amendments

## Contribution Calculation Example

### Scenario
- Owner age: 55
- Target retirement age: 65
- Current income: $400,000
- Employees: 2 (ages 30 and 35, earning $50,000 each)

### DB Plan Contribution Calculation

**Owner (Age 55, 10 years to retirement)**
- Target benefit: $275,000/year (max)
- Contribution needed: ~$230,000/year

**Employee 1 (Age 30, 35 years to retirement)**
- Target benefit (proportional): $47,500/year
- Contribution needed: ~$5,000/year

**Employee 2 (Age 35, 30 years to retirement)**
- Target benefit (proportional): $47,500/year
- Contribution needed: ~$7,000/year

**Total Annual Cost**: ~$242,000
- Owner portion: 95%
- Employee portion: 5%

**Tax Savings** (at 37% federal + 5% state):
$242,000 × 42% = **$101,640 annually**

## DB/DC Combination Strategy

### Maximum Savings Approach

1. **Establish Cash Balance Plan**
   - Maximum benefit formula
   - Owner contribution: $200,000+

2. **Add 401(k) Component**
   - Employee deferrals: $30,500 (if 50+)
   - Employer match: Additional amounts

3. **Combined Result**
   - Total deductible contributions: $250,000+
   - Tax savings at 40%: $100,000+

### Case Study: DB/DC Combo

Dr. Smith, age 58, owns dental practice. Income: $500,000.

| Plan Component | Contribution | Tax Savings (40%) |
|----------------|-------------:|------------------:|
| Cash Balance DB | $220,000 | $88,000 |
| 401(k) Deferral | $30,500 | $12,200 |
| Employer 401(k) | $25,000 | $10,000 |
| **Total** | **$275,500** | **$110,200** |

## Risks & Considerations

### Funding Obligation Risk
- Required contributions even in down years
- Poor investment returns increase required contributions
- Business downturn doesn't eliminate funding requirement
- Personal liability for owner in many cases

### Investment Risk
- Underfunded plans require additional contributions
- Must meet actuarial assumed rate of return
- Market volatility increases funding volatility
- Conservative assumptions recommended

### Employee Cost Risk
- Must cover eligible employees
- New hires may increase costs
- Older employees cost more to cover
- Turnover affects funding requirements

### Termination Complexity
- Plan termination is complex and costly
- Must fully fund benefits upon termination
- IRS and PBGC notification required
- Professional assistance essential

### Regulatory Burden
- Annual actuarial valuations required
- Form 5500 filing mandatory
- Multiple compliance tests
- Plan amendment requirements

## Exit Strategies

### Plan Termination
1. File PBGC Form 500 (if applicable)
2. Notify participants
3. Fund all accrued benefits
4. Distribute assets or purchase annuities
5. File final Form 5500

### Conversion Options
- Convert to frozen plan (no new accruals)
- Spin-off to different entity
- Merge with another plan
- Transfer to successor employer

### Business Sale Considerations
- Buyer may assume plan
- Assets may be distributed at sale
- Plan termination may be required
- Due diligence critical
