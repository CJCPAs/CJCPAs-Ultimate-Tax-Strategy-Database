# Net Operating Loss (NOL) Planning

## Overview

A Net Operating Loss (NOL) occurs when a taxpayer's tax deductions exceed taxable income in a given year. NOLs can be valuable tax assets, allowing businesses and individuals to offset income in other years. However, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 significantly changed NOL rules, limiting carrybacks and imposing an 80% taxable income limitation. Understanding post-TCJA NOL rules is essential for effective tax planning.

## Effective Dates & Key Law Changes

| Provision | Pre-TCJA (Before 2018) | TCJA (2018-2020) | Current (2021+) | 2026+ |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Carryback | 2 years (general) | **No carryback** | No carryback | No carryback |
| Carryforward | 20 years | Indefinite | Indefinite | Indefinite |
| Limitation | None | 80% of taxable income | 80% of taxable income | Same |
| CARES Act Exception | N/A | 5-year carryback (2018-2020) | N/A | N/A |
| Farming NOLs | 5-year carryback | 2-year carryback | 2-year carryback | Same |
| Insurance Co. NOLs | Special rules | 2-year carryback | 2-year carryback | Same |

**Key Change:** The 80% limitation means NOLs can no longer fully eliminate taxable income in any year.

### Who Can Have an NOL?

| Entity Type | NOL Treatment |
|-------------|---------------|
| Individuals | Generate/use NOL from trade/business |
| C-Corporations | Generate/use corporate NOL |
| S-Corporations | NOLs pass through to shareholders |
| Partnerships | NOLs pass through to partners |
| Trusts/Estates | Can generate/use NOLs |

### What Creates an NOL (Individuals)

**Included in NOL Calculation:**
- Business losses (Schedule C)
- Partnership/S-Corp losses (pass-through)
- Rental real estate losses (if deductible)
- Farm losses
- Casualty/theft losses (business)
- Moving expenses (military only)

**NOT Included:**
- Personal exemptions (pre-2018)
- Standard/itemized deductions (most)
- Capital losses (beyond $3,000 limit)
- NOL deduction itself

## The 80% Limitation

### How It Works

**Formula:**
```
Maximum NOL Deduction = 80% × (Taxable Income before NOL)
```

**Example:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Taxable income (before NOL) | $1,000,000 |
| NOL available | $2,000,000 |
| 80% limitation | $800,000 |
| NOL deduction | $800,000 |
| **Taxable income after NOL** | **$200,000** |
| NOL carryforward | $1,200,000 |

### Impact of 80% Limitation

**Taxpayer Always Has Some Tax:**
| Taxable Income | NOL Available | NOL Used | Taxable After NOL |
|----------------|---------------|----------|-------------------|
| $100,000 | $500,000 | $80,000 | $20,000 |
| $500,000 | $500,000 | $400,000 | $100,000 |
| $1,000,000 | $500,000 | $500,000 | $500,000 |
| $1,000,000 | $2,000,000 | $800,000 | $200,000 |

### Pre-2018 NOLs (Transition Rule)

**NOLs from years before 2018:**
- NOT subject to 80% limitation
- Still subject to 20-year carryforward limit
- Use FIFO ordering (oldest NOLs first)

**Ordering:**
1. Pre-2018 NOLs (no 80% limit, but expires)
2. Post-2017 NOLs (80% limit, indefinite)

## NOL Carryback Exceptions

### Farming Losses

**2-Year Carryback Available:**
- Losses from farming business
- Elected on Form 1045 or 1040-X
- Can waive carryback

### Insurance Companies

**2-Year Carryback Available:**
- Non-life insurance companies
- Specific rules under Section 172(b)(1)(C)

### Waiving the Carryback

**Even when allowed, can elect to waive:**
- Attach statement to timely filed return
- "Taxpayer elects under Section 172(b)(3) to waive carryback"
- Once made, irrevocable

## Client Fit Criteria

### When NOL Planning Matters

| Situation | Priority |
|-----------|----------|
| Business generating losses | Critical |
| Startup phase | High |
| Real estate investor with losses | High |
| Cyclical business | High |
| Business acquisition (target NOLs) | Critical |
| Ownership change occurring | Critical |

### NOL Value Analysis

**Value of NOL:**
```
NOL Value = NOL Amount × Expected Tax Rate × Present Value Factor
```

**Example:**
| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| NOL Amount | $1,000,000 |
| Expected tax rate | 37% |
| Present value factor (5 years, 5%) | 0.784 |
| **NOL Value** | **$290,080** |

### Factors Affecting NOL Value

| Factor | Impact on Value |
|--------|-----------------|
| Tax rate when used | Higher rate = more value |
| Time until used | Longer = less value (PV) |
| 80% limitation | Extends use period |
| Ownership changes | May limit usage |
| Expiration (pre-2018) | Creates deadline |

## NOL Planning Strategies

### Strategy 1: Accelerate Income into NOL Year

**If have NOL carryforward:**
- Recognize income in year with NOL
- NOL offsets income (at 80% limit)
- Better than letting NOL erode

**Example:**
- NOL carryforward: $500,000
- Normal income: $200,000
- Accelerated income: $300,000
- Total income: $500,000
- NOL deduction (80%): $400,000
- Taxable: $100,000
- NOL remaining: $100,000

### Strategy 2: Defer Deductions to Future Years

**If have NOL that will absorb income:**
- Defer discretionary deductions
- Take deductions in years without NOL
- Maximize value of both

**Deductions that can be timed:**
- Retirement plan contributions
- Bonus depreciation elections
- Bonus payments to employees
- Prepaid expenses

### Strategy 3: Maximize Business vs. Non-Business

**For individuals:**
- Only business items create NOL
- Optimize deduction character
- Structure activities as trade/business

**Example:**
| Item | Business | Non-Business |
|------|----------|--------------|
| Gross income | $100,000 | $50,000 |
| Deductions | $200,000 | $60,000 |
| Net | ($100,000) | ($10,000) |
| **NOL** | **$100,000** | **$0** |

### Strategy 4: Section 382 Planning (Ownership Changes)

**Before ownership change:**
- Use NOLs if possible
- Document value of loss corporation
- Structure to minimize limitation

**Section 382 Limitation:**
```
Annual Limit = Value of Loss Corp × Long-Term Tax-Exempt Rate
```

### Strategy 5: Built-In Gains/Losses (NUBIG/NUBIL)

**If loss corp has built-in gains:**
- Recognize within 5 years
- Increases Section 382 limit
- RBIG adds to annual limit

**If loss corp has built-in losses:**
- Recognition limited
- RBIL reduces NOL like new loss

### Strategy 6: Separate Return Limitation Year (SRLY)

**For consolidated groups:**
- Pre-acquisition NOLs limited
- Can only offset that member's income
- Plan around SRLY rules

## Section 382 Limitations

### What Triggers Section 382?

**Ownership Change Occurs When:**
- 5% shareholders increase ownership
- By more than 50 percentage points
- During any 3-year testing period

**Common Triggers:**
- Stock sales
- Stock issuances
- Debt-to-equity conversions
- Redemptions
- Options/warrants

### Section 382 Calculation

**Annual Limitation:**
```
Section 382 Limit = FMV of Loss Corp × Long-Term Tax-Exempt Rate
```

**Example (2025):**
| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Loss corporation FMV | $10,000,000 |
| Long-term tax-exempt rate | 4.5% |
| **Annual Section 382 limit** | **$450,000** |

**Result:** Only $450,000 of pre-change NOL usable per year

### Avoiding/Minimizing Section 382

| Strategy | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| Structure ownership carefully | Stay under 50% threshold |
| Use debt instead of equity | Debt doesn't count |
| Small issuance exception | Under 382(l)(3) limits |
| Bankruptcy exception | Section 382(l)(5)/(6) |
| Maximize value before change | Higher limit |

## Corporate NOL Considerations

### C-Corporation NOLs

**Key Points:**
- Stay at corporate level
- 80% limitation applies
- No carryback (post-TCJA)
- Indefinite carryforward
- Watch Section 382 on acquisitions

### S-Corporation NOLs

**Key Points:**
- Pass through to shareholders
- Limited by basis, at-risk, passive rules
- Shareholder-level 80% limit
- Conversion to C-Corp: NOLs don't transfer

### Acquiring NOL Corporations

**Due Diligence:**
1. Verify NOL amounts and years
2. Check for prior ownership changes
3. Calculate Section 382 limitation
4. Assess usability timeline
5. Value NOLs in purchase price

## Case Study

### Scenario

TechStartup Inc. (C-Corp):
- Pre-2018 NOL: $500,000 (expires 2033)
- Post-2017 NOL: $2,000,000 (no expiration)
- Total NOL: $2,500,000
- 2025 projected taxable income: $1,000,000
- 2026+ projected: $800,000/year

### NOL Utilization Analysis

**2025:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Taxable income (before NOL) | $1,000,000 |
| Pre-2018 NOL (no 80% limit) | ($500,000) |
| Remaining income | $500,000 |
| Post-2017 NOL (80% of $500K) | ($400,000) |
| **Taxable income** | **$100,000** |
| **Tax (21%)** | **$21,000** |

NOL carryforward: $1,600,000

**2026:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Taxable income (before NOL) | $800,000 |
| Post-2017 NOL (80% limit) | ($640,000) |
| **Taxable income** | **$160,000** |
| **Tax (21%)** | **$33,600** |

NOL carryforward: $960,000

**2027:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Taxable income (before NOL) | $800,000 |
| Post-2017 NOL (80% limit) | ($640,000) |
| **Taxable income** | **$160,000** |

NOL carryforward: $320,000

**2028:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Taxable income (before NOL) | $800,000 |
| Post-2017 NOL (remaining) | ($320,000) |
| **Taxable income** | **$480,000** |

NOL fully utilized after 4 years

### Planning Opportunity

**Accelerate $500,000 income to 2025:**
| Item | Without Acceleration | With Acceleration |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 2025 taxable income | $100,000 | $500,000 |
| 2025 tax | $21,000 | $105,000 |
| Total 4-year tax | ~$188,000 | ~$188,000 |

No benefit from acceleration due to 80% limit!

**Better Strategy:** Focus on maximizing value through timing and planning, not acceleration.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Forgetting 80% limitation | Unexpected tax liability | Model cash flow properly |
| Missing pre-2018 expiration | Lost NOLs | Track expiration dates |
| Triggering Section 382 | Limited annual use | Monitor ownership changes |
| Not tracking basis (S-Corp) | Suspended losses | Maintain basis schedules |
| Ignoring SRLY rules | Lost group NOLs | Analyze before acquisition |
| Waiving carryback unnecessarily | Lost refund opportunity | Analyze before electing |
