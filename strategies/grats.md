# Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs)

## Overview

A Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT) is an irrevocable trust that allows a grantor to transfer appreciating assets to beneficiaries with minimal or no gift tax. The grantor retains an annuity payment for a specified term, and any growth above the IRS assumed rate (Section 7520 rate) passes to beneficiaries tax-free. GRATs are one of the most powerful estate planning tools for transferring wealth.

## Key Benefits

- Transfer appreciation above 7520 rate gift-tax-free
- "Zeroed-out" GRAT eliminates gift tax entirely
- Grantor retains income stream during trust term
- No use of lifetime gift tax exemption (if properly structured)
- Particularly effective in low interest rate environments
- Can be "rolled" into successive GRATs
- Failed GRAT returns assets with no negative consequence

## How GRATs Work

### Basic Structure

### Key Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Grantor | Creates and funds the trust |
| Annuity | Fixed payment returned to grantor each year |
| Term | Duration of annuity payments (typically 2-10 years) |
| Remainder | Amount passing to beneficiaries at end of term |
| 7520 Rate | IRS assumed growth rate (changes monthly) |

### Section 7520 Rate

| Month | 7520 Rate |
|-------|-----------|
| January 2024 | 5.4% |
| July 2024 | 5.6% |
| January 2025 | 5.2% |

*Rates fluctuate monthly based on federal mid-term rates*

## GRAT Mathematics

### Zeroed-Out GRAT Calculation

**Goal**: Structure annuity so present value equals contributed assets (zero taxable gift)

**Formula:**
```
Annuity Payment = FMV of Assets ÷ Annuity Factor

Where Annuity Factor = [1 - (1 + r)^-n] ÷ r
r = Section 7520 rate
n = Trust term in years
```

**Example: $1,000,000 GRAT, 5.0% rate, 2-year term**
- Annuity factor: 1.8594
- Annual annuity: $1,000,000 ÷ 1.8594 = $537,839
- Total annuity payments: $1,075,678
- Taxable gift: ~$0

### GRAT Success Scenario

If assets grow at 10% (above 5% 7520 rate):

| Year | Beginning Value | Growth (10%) | Annuity Payment | Ending Value |
|------|---------------:|-------------:|----------------:|-------------:|
| 1 | $1,000,000 | $100,000 | ($537,839) | $562,161 |
| 2 | $562,161 | $56,216 | ($537,839) | $80,538 |

**Result**: $80,538 passes to beneficiaries gift-tax-free

### GRAT Failure Scenario

If assets grow at only 3%:

| Year | Beginning Value | Growth (3%) | Annuity Payment | Ending Value |
|------|---------------:|------------:|----------------:|-------------:|
| 1 | $1,000,000 | $30,000 | ($537,839) | $492,161 |
| 2 | $492,161 | $14,765 | ($506,926)* | $0 |

*Adjusted payment to exhaust trust

**Result**: Nothing passes to beneficiaries, but no harm done—assets return to grantor

## Requirements

### Legal Requirements
- Irrevocable trust
- Fixed annuity amount (or increasing by up to 20% annually)
- Annuity must be paid at least annually
- Term must be fixed (not tied to grantor's life for zeroed-out GRAT)
- Cannot be commuted (prepaid)

### IRS Requirements
- Trust must meet IRC Section 2702 requirements
- Annuity must be "qualified interest"
- Cannot have "retained interest" beyond annuity
- Gift tax return (Form 709) required

### Mortality Risk
- If grantor dies during term, assets included in estate
- For zeroed-out GRAT, no worse than not doing GRAT
- Short terms reduce mortality risk
- Consider life insurance to hedge

## Client Fit Criteria

### Ideal Candidates
- Owners of appreciating assets
- Those expecting returns above 7520 rate
- Individuals with existing estate tax exposure
- Business owners anticipating liquidity event
- Those with concentrated stock positions
- Individuals in good health (for longer-term GRATs)

### Ideal Assets for GRATs
- Pre-IPO stock
- Closely-held business interests
- Real estate expected to appreciate
- Growth stocks
- Assets about to increase in value
- S corporation stock (with planning)

### Less Ideal Candidates
- Those needing asset income for living expenses
- Individuals in poor health
- Assets not expected to outperform 7520 rate
- Those with simple estates below exemption

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Planning and Design

1. **Asset Selection**
   - Identify high-growth potential assets
   - Obtain qualified appraisal if needed
   - Ensure assets can satisfy annuity payments
   - Consider liquidity for annuity payments

2. **Term Selection**
   - Balance growth opportunity vs. mortality risk
   - Shorter terms (2-3 years) reduce risk
   - Longer terms (8-10 years) increase growth potential
   - Consider rolling GRAT strategy

3. **Rate Analysis**
   - Monitor Section 7520 rates
   - Lower rates = lower hurdle = better
   - Can lock in rate for 2 months before funding

4. **Annuity Structure**
   - Level annuity (most common)
   - Increasing annuity (up to 20% annual increase)
   - Front-loaded returns more to grantor
   - Back-loaded maximizes wealth transfer

### Phase 2: Trust Creation

1. **Draft Trust Document**
   - Work with qualified estate attorney
   - Include qualified annuity language
   - Name beneficiaries and trustees
   - Consider pour-over to dynasty trust

2. **Administrative Setup**
   - Obtain EIN for trust
   - Open trust bank account
   - Establish record-keeping system
   - Set annuity payment schedule

### Phase 3: Funding

1. **Transfer Assets**
   - Deed real estate to trust
   - Re-register securities
   - Assign business interests
   - Document fair market value

2. **File Gift Tax Return**
   - Form 709 required even for zeroed-out GRAT
   - Report transfer and valuation
   - Adequate disclosure starts limitations period

### Phase 4: Administration

1. **Annual Requirements**
   - Make annuity payments timely
   - Can be cash or in-kind distributions
   - Document fair market value of in-kind payments
   - Maintain trust accounting

2. **Tax Reporting**
   - Grantor trust = no separate income tax return
   - Income reported on grantor's Form 1040
   - Grantor pays income tax (further reduces estate)

3. **Term Completion**
   - Distribute remainder to beneficiaries
   - Or pour into continuing trust
   - File final accounting

## Advanced GRAT Strategies

### Rolling GRATs

**Concept**: Fund successive short-term GRATs to manage mortality risk while capturing appreciation

**Structure:**
```
Year 1: Fund GRAT #1 (2-year term)
Year 2: Fund GRAT #2 (2-year term)
Year 3: GRAT #1 remainder → GRAT #3
Year 4: GRAT #2 remainder → GRAT #4
(Continue rolling)
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces mortality risk
- Captures short-term appreciation events
- Failed GRATs restart fresh
- Successful GRATs compound

### Shark-Fin GRAT

**Structure**: Back-loaded annuity with small initial payments, large final payment

**Example ($1,000,000, 10-year term):**
- Years 1-9: $10,000/year
- Year 10: Balloon payment of ~$900,000

**Benefits:**
- Maximizes growth time before large payment
- Greater wealth transfer potential
- Higher risk if assets underperform

### GRAT with Life Insurance

**Strategy**: Use annuity payments to fund life insurance trust

**Structure:**
1. Create GRAT with annual annuity
2. Create ILIT for life insurance
3. Gift annuity payments to ILIT (using annual exclusion)
4. ILIT purchases life insurance on grantor
5. If grantor dies during GRAT term, insurance proceeds replace lost transfer

### Sale to IDGT Combined with GRAT

**Strategy**: Maximize wealth transfer using both techniques

**Structure:**
1. Fund GRAT with appreciating asset
2. GRAT remainder pours into IDGT
3. Sell additional assets to IDGT for note
4. Double leverage of estate planning techniques

## Risks & Considerations

### Mortality Risk
- Death during term = estate inclusion
- Zeroed-out GRAT: no worse than no planning
- Short terms mitigate risk
- Consider health status

### Investment Risk
- Assets must outperform 7520 rate
- Underperformance = no wealth transfer
- Diversified assets reduce but don't eliminate risk
- Concentrated positions increase both risk and reward

### Interest Rate Risk
- Higher 7520 rates = higher hurdle
- Monitor rates when planning
- Lock in favorable rates
- Consider waiting for rate decreases

### Legislative Risk
- Proposals to require minimum 10-year terms
- Proposals to require minimum gift element
- Grandfathering typically applies
- Act before potential law changes

### Administrative Complexity
- Annual annuity payments required
- In-kind payments require valuation
- Trust accounting necessary
- Professional administration recommended

### State Law Considerations
- Some states have estate tax
- GRAT effectiveness varies by state
- Consider state of trust situs
- State income tax on trust varies

## Case Study

### Scenario
Margaret, age 60, owns $5 million in pre-IPO stock (basis: $500,000). The company plans to go public in 18 months at an expected valuation of $15 million for her shares.

### GRAT Strategy

**Structure:**
- 2-year zeroed-out GRAT
- Section 7520 rate: 5.0%
- Annual annuity: $2,689,195
- Taxable gift: ~$0

### Projected Outcomes

**If IPO successful ($15M value):**

| Year | Beginning Value | Growth | Annuity Payment | Ending Value |
|------|---------------:|-------:|----------------:|-------------:|
| 1 | $5,000,000 | $5,000,000 | ($2,689,195) | $7,310,805 |
| 2 | $7,310,805 | $2,000,000 | ($2,689,195) | $6,621,610 |

**Result:**
- Remainder to beneficiaries: $6,621,610
- Gift tax: $0
- Estate tax saved (40%): $2,648,644

**If IPO fails (stock worth $3M):**

| Year | Beginning Value | Growth | Annuity Payment | Ending Value |
|------|---------------:|-------:|----------------:|-------------:|
| 1 | $5,000,000 | ($1,000,000) | ($2,689,195) | $1,310,805 |
| 2 | $1,310,805 | ($310,805) | ($1,000,000)* | $0 |

*Trust exhausted

**Result:**
- Remainder to beneficiaries: $0
- No downside—Margaret receives assets back through annuity

### Alternative: Rolling GRAT Approach

Instead of single 2-year GRAT, Margaret could use four 6-month GRATs:
- GRAT 1: $1,250,000 (Jan-June Year 1)
- GRAT 2: $1,250,000 (July-Dec Year 1)
- GRAT 3: $1,250,000 (Jan-June Year 2)
- GRAT 4: $1,250,000 (July-Dec Year 2)

**Benefits:**
- Lower mortality risk
- Captures appreciation at multiple points
- Failed GRATs can be re-funded

## GRAT vs. Other Techniques

| Technique | Gift Tax | Estate Inclusion Risk | Income Tax | Complexity |
|-----------|----------|----------------------|------------|------------|
| GRAT | Zero (if zeroed-out) | If die during term | Grantor pays | Medium |
| IDGT Sale | Uses exemption | None (if structured properly) | Grantor pays | High |
| FLP/LLC | Discounted gift | None | Pass-through | High |
| Outright Gift | Full value | None | Carryover basis | Low |
