# Roth Conversion Strategies

## Overview

A Roth conversion involves transferring funds from a traditional IRA, 401(k), or other pre-tax retirement account to a Roth IRA, paying income tax on the converted amount now in exchange for tax-free growth and withdrawals in the future. Strategic Roth conversions can significantly reduce lifetime taxes, especially during low-income years or when future tax rates are expected to rise.

## Key Benefits

- Tax-free growth on converted amounts
- Tax-free qualified withdrawals in retirement
- No Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) during owner's lifetime
- Tax diversification in retirement
- Estate planning benefits (tax-free inheritance)
- Hedge against future tax rate increases
- Reduce future RMDs from traditional accounts

## How Roth Conversions Work

### Basic Mechanics

```
┌─────────────────┐      Conversion      ┌─────────────────┐
│  Traditional    │ ──────────────────►  │    Roth IRA     │
│     IRA         │                      │                 │
│  (Pre-tax $)    │                      │  (After-tax $)  │
└─────────────────┘                      └─────────────────┘
         │                                        │
         │                                        │
         ▼                                        ▼
   No tax until                            Tax-free growth
   withdrawal                              Tax-free withdrawal
   RMDs at 73                              No RMDs
```

### Tax Treatment

| Item | Traditional IRA | Roth IRA |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| Contributions | Pre-tax (deductible) | After-tax |
| Growth | Tax-deferred | Tax-free |
| Withdrawals | Taxed as ordinary income | Tax-free (if qualified) |
| RMDs | Required at age 73 | None during owner's lifetime |
| Conversion | N/A | Taxed as ordinary income |

### Conversion Taxation

**Fully Deductible Traditional IRA:**
- Entire conversion amount = ordinary income
- Added to other income for the year
- May push into higher bracket

**Partially Non-Deductible Traditional IRA (Pro-Rata Rule):**
- Cannot convert only non-deductible portion
- Must prorate based on ALL traditional IRAs
- Aggregation rule applies

**Pro-Rata Example:**
```
Total Traditional IRA: $100,000
Non-deductible basis: $20,000
Taxable percentage: 80%

$50,000 conversion:
- Taxable: $50,000 × 80% = $40,000
- Non-taxable: $50,000 × 20% = $10,000
```

## Types of Roth Conversions

### Standard Conversion
- Transfer from Traditional IRA to Roth IRA
- Pay tax in conversion year
- No income limits
- No conversion limits

### Backdoor Roth IRA
**For high earners above Roth contribution limits:**
1. Contribute to non-deductible Traditional IRA
2. Convert to Roth IRA
3. Pay tax only on gains (if any)
4. Avoid pro-rata issues by keeping no other traditional IRA funds

**Income Limits (2024):**
- Roth contribution phases out: $146,000-$161,000 (single), $230,000-$240,000 (MFJ)
- Backdoor Roth: No income limit

### Mega Backdoor Roth
**For those with 401(k) plans allowing after-tax contributions:**
1. Max out pre-tax 401(k): $23,000
2. Make after-tax contributions up to $69,000 total limit
3. Convert after-tax portion to Roth (in-plan or to Roth IRA)
4. Up to $46,000+ additional Roth savings

**Requirements:**
- Plan must allow after-tax contributions
- Plan must allow in-service withdrawals or in-plan conversions
- Not all 401(k) plans offer this

### In-Plan Roth Conversion
- Convert within 401(k) to Roth 401(k)
- No distribution required
- Same tax consequences
- Subject to plan rules

## Requirements

### Roth Conversion Requirements
- Have traditional IRA or eligible employer plan funds
- Pay ordinary income tax on converted amount
- No income limits for conversion (only for contributions)
- No age restrictions
- No limit on conversion amount

### Qualified Distribution Requirements (Tax-Free)
- Account open 5+ years (from January 1 of conversion year)
- AND one of:
  - Age 59½ or older
  - Death
  - Disability
  - First home ($10,000 lifetime limit)

### Five-Year Rules

**Rule 1: Contributions**
- Roth must be open 5 years for earnings to be tax-free
- Starts January 1 of first Roth contribution year
- One clock for all Roth IRAs

**Rule 2: Conversions (Under 59½)**
- Each conversion has separate 5-year clock
- 10% penalty on converted amount if withdrawn before 5 years
- Does not affect tax-free status of qualified distributions

## Client Fit Criteria

### Ideal Candidates

| Characteristic | Why Favorable |
|----------------|---------------|
| Currently in low tax bracket | Pay tax at low rate now |
| Young with long time horizon | Maximize tax-free growth |
| Large traditional IRA, modest income | Spread conversions over years |
| Expecting higher future tax rates | Avoid future higher rates |
| No near-term need for funds | Don't need converted funds soon |
| Want to leave tax-free inheritance | Roth IRAs pass tax-free |
| Want to avoid RMDs | Roth has no lifetime RMDs |

### Conversion Triggers

| Situation | Opportunity |
|-----------|-------------|
| Job loss/gap year | Low income year |
| Early retirement before SS/pension | Low income years |
| Business loss year | Offset conversion income |
| Large deduction year | Charitable, casualty loss |
| Market downturn | Convert more shares at lower value |
| Year before high income | Last low-bracket year |
| Moving to high-tax state | Convert before move |

### Less Ideal Candidates
- Need funds within 5 years (under 59½)
- Already in highest tax bracket with no expected decrease
- Cannot pay conversion tax from non-IRA funds
- Very short remaining life expectancy
- Live in state with no income tax, moving to tax state

## Implementation Strategies

### Strategy 1: Fill the Bracket

**Concept**: Convert enough each year to fill current tax bracket without spilling into next

**2024 Tax Brackets (MFJ):**
| Bracket | Income Range |
|---------|--------------|
| 10% | $0 - $23,200 |
| 12% | $23,201 - $94,300 |
| 22% | $94,301 - $201,050 |
| 24% | $201,051 - $383,900 |
| 32% | $383,901 - $487,450 |
| 35% | $487,451 - $731,200 |
| 37% | $731,201+ |

**Example:**
- Current taxable income: $150,000
- Room in 22% bracket: $201,050 - $150,000 = $51,050
- Convert $51,050 at 22%
- Tax cost: $11,231
- Avoid 24%+ on this amount in future

### Strategy 2: Roth Conversion Ladder

**For early retirees:**
1. Retire with traditional IRA/401(k) funds
2. Convert amount needed for living expenses 5 years out
3. Wait 5 years (live on other savings)
4. Withdraw converted amounts penalty-free
5. Repeat annually

**Timeline:**
| Year | Action | Available Tax-Free |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| 2024 | Convert $50,000 | - |
| 2025 | Convert $50,000 | - |
| 2026 | Convert $50,000 | - |
| 2027 | Convert $50,000 | - |
| 2028 | Convert $50,000 | - |
| 2029 | Withdraw 2024 conversion | $50,000 |
| 2030 | Withdraw 2025 conversion | $50,000 |

### Strategy 3: Market Downturn Conversions

**Convert when market is down:**
- Same number of shares, lower dollar value
- Pay less tax on conversion
- Subsequent recovery occurs tax-free in Roth

**Example:**
- IRA holds 1,000 shares at $100 = $100,000
- Market drops 30%: 1,000 shares at $70 = $70,000
- Convert at $70,000 value
- Market recovers: 1,000 shares at $100 = $100,000
- Tax paid on $70,000, $30,000 recovery tax-free

### Strategy 4: Tax Diversification

**Goal**: Create balance between pre-tax and Roth assets

**Target Allocation:**
- 1/3 traditional (pre-tax)
- 1/3 Roth (tax-free)
- 1/3 taxable (flexible)

**Benefits:**
- Flexibility in retirement withdrawals
- Manage tax brackets annually
- Hedge against tax law changes
- Optimize Social Security taxation

### Strategy 5: RMD Reduction

**Problem**: Large traditional IRA = large RMDs = high taxes in retirement

**Solution**: Convert before RMDs begin

**Example:**
| Scenario | Age 73 Traditional IRA | Annual RMD | Tax (24%) |
|----------|----------------------|------------|-----------|
| No conversion | $2,000,000 | $75,472 | $18,113 |
| Convert $500K | $1,500,000 | $56,604 | $13,585 |
| Convert $1M | $1,000,000 | $37,736 | $9,057 |

### Strategy 6: Estate Planning Conversion

**For those who don't need IRA funds:**
- Convert and pay tax from taxable assets
- Beneficiaries inherit tax-free Roth
- Reduces taxable estate (tax paid from estate)
- Stretch period for inherited Roth (10 years) is tax-free

## Backdoor Roth Detailed

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Ensure No Traditional IRA Balance**
   - Roll traditional IRAs to 401(k) if possible
   - Avoids pro-rata taxation

2. **Contribute to Non-Deductible Traditional IRA**
   - $7,000 limit (2024)
   - $8,000 if 50+
   - Don't invest (keep in money market)

3. **Convert to Roth IRA**
   - Wait a "reasonable" time (days to weeks)
   - Request conversion from custodian
   - Minimal or no gains to tax

4. **File Form 8606**
   - Report non-deductible contribution
   - Report conversion
   - Track basis

### Pro-Rata Rule Workaround

**Problem**: $500,000 traditional IRA + $7,000 non-deductible contribution
- Pro-rata: 98.6% of conversion is taxable

**Solution**: Reverse rollover
1. Roll traditional IRA into current 401(k)
2. Now only non-deductible IRA remains
3. Convert with minimal tax
4. Must have 401(k) that accepts rollovers

## Risks & Considerations

### Tax Rate Risk
- Future rates may be lower than expected
- Conversion locks in current rate
- Hedge with partial conversions

### Liquidity Risk
- Conversion tax due in April
- Should pay from non-IRA funds
- Paying from IRA reduces effectiveness

### Investment Risk
- Converted assets may decline
- Can no longer "recharacterize" (removed in 2018)
- Convert in tranches to reduce timing risk

### Legislative Risk
- Backdoor Roth proposals have threatened strategy
- Build Back Better would have eliminated (didn't pass)
- Future legislation uncertain
- Act while rules allow

### Medicare Premium Impact
- Conversion income affects IRMAA
- 2-year look-back period
- Can spike Medicare premiums
- Plan conversions with IRMAA in mind

### State Tax Considerations
- Some states don't tax retirement distributions
- May not want to convert if moving to no-tax state
- Some states have different Roth rules
- Consider state in optimization

## Case Study

### Scenario
Tom and Linda, both 60, plan to retire at 62:
- Combined traditional IRA/401(k): $2,000,000
- Taxable investments: $500,000
- No Roth assets
- Pension (starting at 65): $50,000/year
- Social Security (starting at 67): $60,000/year combined

### Current Projection (No Conversion)

**At age 73:**
- Traditional balance (7% growth): ~$4,900,000
- RMD: ~$185,000
- Plus pension: $50,000
- Plus SS: $60,000
- Total income: $295,000
- Tax bracket: 32%+
- Medicare IRMAA: Highest tier

### Roth Conversion Strategy

**Ages 62-72 (10-year window):**
- Annual conversion: $150,000
- Fill 24% bracket
- Tax per year: ~$36,000
- Total tax: ~$360,000
- Total converted: $1,500,000

### Results Comparison

| Metric | No Conversion | With Conversions |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| Traditional IRA at 73 | $4,900,000 | ~$2,000,000 |
| Roth IRA at 73 | $0 | ~$3,000,000 |
| RMD at 73 | $185,000 | $75,472 |
| Taxable income | $295,000 | $185,472 |
| Tax bracket | 32% | 22-24% |
| IRMAA | Maximum | Minimal |
| Lifetime tax savings | — | ~$400,000+ |

### Additional Benefits
- Heirs receive $3M tax-free Roth
- Flexibility to manage income annually
- Hedge against tax increases
- Lower Medicare premiums

## Conversion Analysis Framework

### Key Questions

1. **What is your current marginal rate?**
2. **What do you expect your future rate to be?**
3. **How long until you need the funds?**
4. **Can you pay tax from non-IRA funds?**
5. **What are your state tax considerations?**
6. **How will this affect Medicare premiums?**
7. **What are your estate planning goals?**

### Break-Even Analysis

**Variables:**
- Current tax rate (Tc)
- Future tax rate (Tf)
- Years of tax-free growth (n)
- Investment return (r)

**Simplified Rule:**
- If Tf > Tc × (1 + r)^n: Conversion favorable
- If Tf < Tc × (1 + r)^n: Deferral favorable
