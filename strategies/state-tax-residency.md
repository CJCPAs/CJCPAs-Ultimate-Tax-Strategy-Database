## Domicile vs. Residence

### Legal Domicile

- Only ONE domicile at a time
- Where you intend to return
- Requires intent AND physical presence

### Statutory Residence
- Some states tax "statutory residents"
- Based on days present + maintaining permanent place of abode
- Can be resident of two states for tax purposes

### Common Tests

**Day Count Rules:**
| State | Days Threshold | Additional Requirements |
|-------|---------------|------------------------|
| New York | 183 days | + Permanent place of abode |
| California | 9+ months | Presumption of residency |
| Connecticut | 183 days | + Permanent place of abode |
| New Jersey | 183 days | Primary residency test |

## Requirements for Domicile Change

### Physical Presence
- Actually move to new state
- Spend majority of time there
- Establish physical presence
- Avoid long stays in prior state

### Intent to Remain
- Must intend new state as permanent home
- Subjective but demonstrated by actions
- Not temporary or for tax purposes only

### Documentation Requirements

**Strong Evidence of New Domicile:**

|----------|---------|
| **Home** | Purchase/rent home in new state; sell/rent prior home |
| **Legal Documents** | Update driver's license, voter registration, vehicle registration, will |

| **Personal** | Move personal belongings, pets, family photos |
| **Employment** | Work from new state (if applicable) |

### Day Count Tracking

**Critical for high-tax state departures:**

- Keep detailed calendar
- Consider cell phone location data
- Aim for <183 days in prior state

## Implementation Strategies

### Strategy 1: Clean Break Relocation

**Complete domicile change:**
1. Purchase/lease new home in destination state
2. Sell or rent prior home
3. Update all documentation within 30 days
4. Register to vote in new state
5. File part-year returns if needed
6. Avoid returning to old state for extended periods

**Best for:** Retirees, those with flexibility, clear moves

### Strategy 2: Staged Relocation

**Gradual transition:**
1. Establish secondary presence in new state
2. Begin shifting activities over 1-2 years
3. Document increasing ties to new state
4. Reduce ties to old state progressively
5. Complete transition

**Best for:** Those with business ties to old state, family considerations

### Strategy 3: Pre-Event Relocation

**For large liquidity events:**
1. Plan exit/sale 2+ years out
2. Establish domicile in no-tax state immediately
3. Build substantial presence in new state
4. Maintain <183 days in prior state
5. Complete transaction after domicile established

**Best for:** Business sales, IPO, large capital gains

### Strategy 4: Snowbird Structure

**Split time between states:**
- Primary domicile in no-tax state (FL, TX, etc.)
- Spend winters there (or summers in vacation areas)
- Must maintain domicile documentation
- Be careful of statutory residence rules

**Risks:**
- High-tax state may challenge
- Day counting critical
- Audit exposure

## State-Specific Considerations

### California Exit Planning

**California's Aggressive Taxation:**
- Taxes worldwide income of residents
- Sources certain income to CA even after departure
- Stock options/RSUs sourced to CA for work performed in CA
- Audits departing high-income residents

**Safe Exit Approach:**
1. Establish domicile elsewhere
2. Do NOT return for >45 days in first year (safer than 60-day rule)
3. Liquidate CA investments before departure if possible
4. Keep meticulous records
5. Expect audit if high-income

**RSU/Option Sourcing:**
- CA taxes based on where services performed
- If granted while CA resident, portion always sourced to CA
- Plan option exercises around residency changes

### New York Exit Planning

**New York's Audit Focus:**
- 183+ days + permanent place of abode = statutory resident
- "Permanent place of abode" broadly defined
- Active audit program for high-income departures

**Best Practices:**
1. Sell or rent (arm's length) NY home
2. Spend fewer than 183 days in NY
3. Document every day (cell phone, credit cards)
4. Change all legal documents immediately
5. Join organizations in new state

**Common Audit Issues:**
- Keeping vacation home in NY (may be "permanent place")
- Children in NY schools
- Close business ties in NY
- Social/cultural ties in NY

### Florida Domicile

**Why Florida is Popular:**
- No income tax
- No estate/inheritance tax
- Strong asset protection (homestead)
- No residency requirement (day count)
- Declaration of Domicile filing

**Florida Declaration of Domicile:**
- File with county clerk
- Sworn statement of domicile
- Creates legal record
- Not conclusive but helpful

### Texas Residency

**Texas Advantages:**
- No income tax
- No estate tax
- Business-friendly
- Growing tech/business hub

**Establishing Texas Residency:**
- No specific declaration required
- Standard domicile factors apply
- Register vehicle, get driver's license
- Voter registration

## Risks & Considerations

### Audit Risk

**High-risk factors:**
- Income over $1 million
- Business ownership in prior state
- Short time between move and large transaction
- Continued ties to prior state
- Prior state has aggressive audit program (CA, NY, NJ, CT)

**Audit Defense Preparation:**
- Contemporary documentation
- Day count logs
- Photos/evidence of new residence
- Professional advice

### Family Complications

**Challenges:**
- Spouse unwilling to move
- Children in prior state schools
- Aging parents in prior state
- Split households create problems

**Solutions:**
- Full family move if possible
- Careful structuring if split required
- Document independent reasons for split

### Business Ties

**Ongoing business in prior state:**
- May source income to that state regardless
- Active involvement = possible residency arguments
- Consider business restructuring

### Tax Treaty/Multi-State Complexity

**Working in multiple states:**
- Each state may claim right to tax
- Credits for taxes paid to other states (imperfect)
- Remote work creates nexus issues
- Need careful multi-state planning
