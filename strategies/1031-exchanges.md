# Section 1031 Like-Kind Exchanges

## Overview

A Section 1031 exchange (also known as a like-kind exchange or tax-deferred exchange) allows real estate investors to defer capital gains taxes when selling investment property by reinvesting the proceeds into replacement property. This powerful strategy enables investors to preserve capital, build wealth through property upgrades, and defer taxes indefinitely—potentially until death when heirs receive a stepped-up basis.

## Effective Dates & Key Law Changes

| Provision | Pre-2018 | 2018-Present | 2026 and Beyond |
|-----------|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Real Property | Like-kind eligible | Like-kind eligible | Like-kind eligible |
| Personal Property | Like-kind eligible | **NOT eligible** | NOT eligible |
| Qualified Intermediary | Required | Required | Required |
| 45-Day ID Period | 45 days | 45 days | 45 days |
| 180-Day Exchange Period | 180 days | 180 days | 180 days |
| Boot Recognition | Required | Required | Required |

**TCJA Impact (2018):** The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated 1031 exchanges for personal property (vehicles, equipment, art, collectibles). Only **real property** now qualifies.

**2026 Note:** No changes to 1031 exchange rules are scheduled. However, various proposals have targeted elimination or limitation—stay alert for legislative changes.

## Key Benefits

- Defer 100% of capital gains taxes
- Defer depreciation recapture (25% rate)
- Preserve capital for reinvestment
- Upgrade to higher-value properties
- Consolidate or diversify holdings
- Geographic relocation of investments
- Potential step-up in basis at death
- No limit on number of exchanges

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Pre-Sale Planning (Critical)

1. **Engage Qualified Intermediary**
   - Select reputable QI
   - Sign exchange agreement BEFORE closing
   - Cannot be last minute

2. **Structure Sale Contract**
   - Include cooperation clause
   - Assignment language for QI
   - Buyer acknowledgment

3. **Begin Replacement Search**
   - Start early (45 days is short)
   - Multiple properties if uncertain
   - Pre-qualify financing

4. **Coordinate Professionals**
   - Real estate attorney
   - CPA for tax planning
   - Real estate broker

### Phase 2: Sale Execution

1. **Close on Relinquished Property**
   - QI involved in closing
   - Proceeds go directly to QI
   - DO NOT receive any funds

2. **Document Everything**
   - HUD-1/Closing statement
   - Assignment to QI
   - Exchange agreement

### Phase 3: Identification Period (Days 1-45)

1. **Identify Replacement Properties**
   - Maximum 3 under 3-property rule
   - Written, signed identification
   - Deliver to QI before midnight Day 45
   - Consider backup properties

2. **Perform Due Diligence**
   - Inspections
   - Title review
   - Financing approval
   - Environmental (if applicable)

3. **Negotiate Purchase Agreements**
   - Include exchange cooperation clause
   - Contingencies as needed
   - Coordinate closing timeline

### Phase 4: Exchange Period (Days 1-180)

1. **Secure Financing**
   - Lender familiar with 1031
   - Timing coordination
   - Debt replacement requirements

2. **Close on Replacement Property**
   - QI provides exchange funds
   - Title in same name/entity
   - Before Day 180 deadline

3. **Acquire Equal or Greater**
   - Value (price)
   - Equity (debt replacement)
   - Avoid boot

### Phase 5: Post-Exchange

1. **Tax Reporting**
   - Form 8824 with tax return
   - Calculate new basis
   - Track deferred gain

2. **Maintain Records**
   - All exchange documents
   - Basis calculations
   - Depreciation schedules

## Boot and Partial Exchanges

### What is Boot?

**Boot = Non-Like-Kind Property Received**

| Type of Boot | Tax Treatment |
|--------------|---------------|
| Cash received | Taxable |
| Debt relief (net) | Taxable |
| Non-real property received | Taxable |

### Avoiding Boot

**Rules for Full Deferral:**
1. Replacement value ≥ Relinquished value
2. New debt ≥ Old debt (or add cash)
3. Reinvest all cash proceeds
4. Receive only like-kind property

### Partial Exchange Example

| Relinquished | Replacement | Boot |
|--------------|-------------|------|
| $1,000,000 (value) | $900,000 (value) | $100,000 cash boot |
| $600,000 (debt) | $500,000 (debt) | $100,000 mortgage boot |

**Total Boot:** $200,000 (taxable to extent of gain)

## Advanced 1031 Strategies

### Strategy 1: Reverse Exchange

**Structure:**
1. EAT (Exchange Accommodation Titleholder) acquires replacement
2. Taxpayer sells relinquished property
3. EAT transfers replacement to taxpayer
4. Same 45/180-day rules apply

**Use When:**
- Found perfect replacement property
- Need to close before selling
- Competitive market

**Requirements:**
- Qualified Exchange Accommodation Agreement
- 180-day parking limit
- Higher costs

### Strategy 2: Improvement/Construction Exchange

**Structure:**
1. QI/EAT holds replacement property
2. Improvements made during exchange period
3. Improved property transferred to taxpayer
4. Improvements count toward value

**Use When:**
- Building new construction
- Significant renovations needed
- Want to exchange into improved property

### Strategy 3: Delaware Statutory Trust (DST)

**Structure:**
- Exchange into fractional DST interest
- Passive investment
- Professional management
- Qualifies as like-kind real property

**Benefits:**
- No management responsibility
- Diversification
- Estate planning flexibility
- Exit from active management

### Strategy 4: Tenancy-in-Common (TIC)

**Structure:**
- Fractional ownership in larger property
- Direct deed ownership
- Co-ownership with others
- Qualifies for 1031

**Considerations:**
- Maximum 35 co-owners
- Decision-making complexity
- Exit challenges

### Strategy 5: Drop and Swap (Entity Planning)

**Issue:** Partnership interests don't qualify for 1031

**Solution:**
1. Partnership distributes property to partners
2. Partners hold for investment period
3. Partners do individual 1031 exchanges

**Timing:** Hold post-distribution for reasonable period (1-2 years safer)

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Receiving funds directly | Exchange fails completely | QI holds all proceeds |
| Missing 45-day deadline | Cannot identify property | Calendar immediately |
| Missing 180-day deadline | Exchange fails | Track both deadlines |
| Wrong property identification | Properties don't qualify | Use 3-property rule carefully |
| Insufficient debt replacement | Boot recognized | Plan financing early |
| Related party QI | Exchange fails | Use independent QI |
| Taking title differently | Potential issue | Same taxpayer/entity |

## Case Study

### Scenario

Jennifer owns a rental property:
- Purchase price (2015): $400,000
- Current FMV: $1,200,000
- Mortgage: $200,000
- Accumulated depreciation: $150,000
- Adjusted basis: $250,000

**Goal:** Upgrade to larger multi-family property

### Tax Analysis Without Exchange

| Item | Amount | Tax Rate | Tax |
|------|--------|----------|-----|
| Sale Price | $1,200,000 | | |
| Adjusted Basis | $250,000 | | |
| Total Gain | $950,000 | | |
| Depreciation Recapture | $150,000 | 25% | $37,500 |
| Capital Gain | $800,000 | 23.8%* | $190,400 |
| State Tax (CA 13.3%) | $950,000 | 13.3% | $126,350 |
| **Total Tax** | | | **$354,250** |

*20% + 3.8% NIIT

**Cash After Sale:** $1,200,000 - $200,000 (mortgage) - $354,250 = **$645,750**

### 1031 Exchange Execution

**Timeline:**
- Day 0: Sell property, proceeds to QI ($1,000,000 net)
- Day 40: Identify 3 replacement properties
- Day 150: Close on $1,500,000 apartment building

**Replacement Property:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Purchase Price | $1,500,000 |
| New Mortgage | $500,000 |
| Exchange Funds from QI | $1,000,000 |
| **Total Tax** | **$0 (deferred)** |

### Results Comparison

| Metric | Without 1031 | With 1031 |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Property Value | $645,750 | $1,500,000 |
| Tax Paid | $354,250 | $0 |
| Investment Capacity | Lower | Higher |
| Future Appreciation Base | $645,750 | $1,500,000 |

**10-Year Projection (5% annual appreciation):**
- Without exchange: $645,750 → $1,052,000
- With exchange: $1,500,000 → $2,443,000
- **Difference:** $1,391,000

## Tax Reporting

### Form 8824

**Required Information:**
- Description of properties exchanged
- Dates of transfers
- Relationship of parties
- Gain/loss calculation
- Basis calculation for replacement

### Basis Calculation

**New Basis = Old Basis + Boot Paid - Boot Received + Gain Recognized**

**Example:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Old Adjusted Basis | $250,000 |
| Add: Cash Paid | $300,000 |
| Add: New Debt | $500,000 |
| Less: Old Debt Relief | ($200,000) |
| **New Basis** | **$850,000** |
