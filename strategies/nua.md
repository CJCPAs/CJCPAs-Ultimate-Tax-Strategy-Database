# Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA) Strategy

## Overview

Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA) is a tax strategy that allows employees to pay long-term capital gains tax rates (instead of ordinary income rates) on the appreciation of employer stock held in a qualified retirement plan. When executed properly, NUA can save hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes on highly appreciated company stock.

## Key Benefits

- Convert ordinary income to long-term capital gains
- Save up to 17% on appreciated employer stock (37% vs. 20%)
- Immediate access to stock (no 10% early withdrawal penalty on NUA)
- Step-up in basis at death for post-distribution appreciation
- Simple execution when requirements are met
- No limit on amount of stock eligible

## How NUA Works

### The Basic Concept

**Without NUA (Standard Distribution):**
- Entire distribution taxed as ordinary income (up to 37%)
- 10% early withdrawal penalty if under 59½
- No distinction between cost basis and appreciation

**With NUA:**
- Cost basis taxed as ordinary income (at distribution)
- Net Unrealized Appreciation taxed as LTCG (at sale)
- NUA not subject to 10% penalty
- Potential 17%+ tax savings on appreciation

### Tax Treatment Comparison

| Component | Without NUA | With NUA |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Cost basis | Ordinary income (37%) | Ordinary income (37%) |
| NUA (appreciation) | Ordinary income (37%) | LTCG (20%) |
| Post-distribution gain | LTCG (20%) | LTCG (20%) |
| 10% penalty (if <59½) | Yes, on full amount | Only on cost basis |

## Requirements (Must Meet ALL)

### 1. Employer Securities
- Must be stock of the employer
- Includes stock of parent or subsidiary
- Does not include mutual funds or other investments
- Stock must be distributed "in kind" (not sold first)

### 2. Lump-Sum Distribution
**Must distribute ENTIRE balance within ONE tax year:**
- All employer stock
- All other investments in the plan
- From ALL similar plans (all 401(k)s, all profit-sharing, etc.)
- Cannot be partial distribution

### 3. Triggering Event
**Distribution must be due to one of:**
- Separation from service (not for self-employed)
- Attainment of age 59½
- Death
- Disability (for self-employed only)

### 4. Participation Requirement
- Must have participated in plan for 5+ years
- OR triggering event is death/disability
- Clock starts at first contribution

## Client Fit Criteria

### Ideal Candidates

| Characteristic | Why It Matters |
|----------------|----------------|
| High NUA relative to cost basis | Maximizes LTCG benefit |
| High tax bracket | Greater ordinary income savings |
| Age 59½+ | Avoids penalty on cost basis |
| Needs current income | Stock accessible immediately |
| Has other retirement assets | Can roll non-stock to IRA |
| Appreciates concentrated risk | Stock remains concentrated |

### NUA Analysis Thresholds

| NUA as % of Value | NUA Attractiveness |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| 80%+ | Highly favorable |
| 60-80% | Usually favorable |
| 40-60% | Analyze carefully |
| Below 40% | Often not favorable |

### Less Ideal Candidates
- Low appreciation in stock
- Need to defer taxes long-term
- Cannot tolerate concentration risk
- Low current tax bracket
- Would face 10% penalty on significant basis

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Analysis

1. **Gather Information**
   - Total shares of employer stock in plan
   - Cost basis (average or specific lot)
   - Current fair market value
   - Other assets in plan
   - Other qualified plans with employer

2. **Calculate NUA**
   ```
   NUA = Current FMV - Cost Basis
   NUA Percentage = NUA / Current FMV
   ```

3. **Tax Comparison**
   - Tax with NUA strategy
   - Tax without NUA (full rollover, later distribution)
   - Tax with partial NUA
   - Consider state taxes

4. **Verify Requirements**
   - Triggering event occurred?
   - 5-year participation met?
   - Can complete lump-sum in one year?
   - Identify all plans of same type

### Phase 2: Execution

1. **Timing Decision**
   - Choose optimal tax year
   - Consider other income in year
   - Coordinate with separation date
   - Avoid straddling calendar years

2. **Distribution Instructions**
   - Request "in-kind" distribution of stock
   - Roll OTHER assets to IRA (if desired)
   - Complete within single tax year
   - Obtain cost basis documentation

3. **Receive Distribution**
   - Stock goes to taxable brokerage account
   - Other assets go to IRA
   - Document dates carefully

4. **Tax Reporting**
   - Form 1099-R from plan
   - Report cost basis as ordinary income
   - Track NUA for future sale
   - Consider estimated tax payments

### Phase 3: Post-Distribution

1. **Stock Sale Decisions**
   - Can sell immediately (NUA is LTCG regardless of holding period)
   - Additional appreciation after distribution:
     - STCG if sold within 1 year
     - LTCG if sold after 1 year

2. **Diversification Planning**
   - Consider selling to reduce concentration
   - Reinvest proceeds appropriately
   - Tax-loss harvesting opportunities
   - Charitable giving strategies

## Advanced Strategies

### Partial NUA Strategy

**Not all-or-nothing for stock:**
- Distribute SOME employer stock (NUA treatment)
- Roll REMAINING employer stock to IRA
- Must still complete lump-sum of entire plan balance
- Balance NUA benefit vs. concentration risk

**Example:**
- Total employer stock: 10,000 shares ($500,000)
- Cost basis: $50,000 ($5/share)
- Strategy: Distribute 5,000 shares, roll 5,000 shares
- NUA on distributed: $225,000 (taxed at LTCG)
- Rolled portion: Deferred until IRA distribution

### Multiple Lot Strategy

If plan tracks specific tax lots:
- Identify lots with highest NUA percentage
- Distribute high-NUA lots
- Roll low-NUA lots to IRA
- Maximizes tax efficiency

### Charitable Giving with NUA Stock

**After NUA Distribution:**
1. Distribute stock using NUA rules
2. Pay ordinary income tax on cost basis
3. Hold stock 1+ year (for post-distribution appreciation)
4. Donate to charity or DAF
5. Deduct FMV, avoid capital gains on NUA + additional gain

### Estate Planning Consideration

**NUA Stock at Death:**
- Cost basis portion: Was already taxed at distribution
- NUA portion: NO step-up (retains NUA character)
- Post-distribution appreciation: DOES get step-up

**Implication**: May want to sell NUA stock before death, invest in other assets that will get full step-up

## Risks & Considerations

### Concentration Risk
- All eggs in one basket
- Company-specific risk
- Sector risk
- Should diversify promptly (but consider tax timing)

### Tax Law Changes
- Capital gains rates could increase
- NUA rules could change
- Current rate differential may not persist
- Consider accelerating if worried about rate increases

### 10% Early Withdrawal Penalty
- If under 59½, penalty applies to cost basis
- NOT to NUA portion
- May offset some NUA benefit for younger taxpayers

### Opportunity Cost
- IRA rollover would defer ALL tax
- NUA requires paying some tax now
- Time value of money consideration
- But rate differential often overcomes deferral benefit

### Execution Errors
- Must complete in single tax year
- Must distribute from ALL similar plans
- In-kind requirement critical
- Errors can invalidate entire strategy

## Case Study

### Scenario
Robert, age 62, is retiring from a Fortune 500 company after 30 years:
- 401(k) balance: $2,000,000
- Employer stock in 401(k): $1,500,000
- Cost basis of stock: $150,000
- Other investments in 401(k): $500,000
- Tax bracket: 37% federal, 5% state = 42%

### Analysis

**NUA Calculation:**
- FMV of stock: $1,500,000
- Cost basis: $150,000
- NUA: $1,350,000
- NUA percentage: 90%

**Tax Comparison:**

| Strategy | Tax on Stock | Tax on Other | Total Tax |
|----------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| Full IRA Rollover (defer) | $0 now | $0 now | $0 now |
| Later IRA distribution | $630,000* | $210,000* | $840,000* |
| NUA Strategy | $63,000 + $283,500** | $0 (roll to IRA) | $346,500 now |

*Assumes 42% rate on entire amount when distributed
**$63,000 = basis × 42%; $283,500 = NUA × 21% (LTCG + NIIT)

### Strategy Comparison Over Time

**Without NUA (Full Rollover):**
- Pay no tax now
- Distributions over 20 years: $2,000,000
- Tax at 42%: $840,000
- Net to Robert: $1,160,000

**With NUA:**
- Pay $346,500 now
- Stock sold: $1,500,000 - $346,500 = $1,153,500 investable
- Other $500,000 in IRA, distributed over 20 years
- Tax on IRA distributions (42%): $210,000
- Total tax: $346,500 + $210,000 = $556,500
- **Tax savings: $283,500**

### Additional Considerations
- Robert can immediately diversify the stock
- Post-distribution appreciation gets LTCG treatment
- If Robert dies, heirs get step-up on post-distribution appreciation
- State tax savings if moves to no-income-tax state before IRA distributions
