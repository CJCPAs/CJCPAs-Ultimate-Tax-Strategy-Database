# Qualified Personal Residence Trusts (QPRTs)

## Overview

A Qualified Personal Residence Trust (QPRT) is an irrevocable trust that allows homeowners to transfer their primary residence or vacation home to beneficiaries at a significantly reduced gift tax value while retaining the right to live in the home for a specified term of years. When the term ends, the home passes to beneficiaries, removing it and all future appreciation from the grantor's taxable estate.

## Effective Dates & Key Law Changes

| Provision | Pre-OBBBA (2024-2025) | Post-OBBBA (July 2025+) |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Gift/Estate Tax Exemption | $13.61M (2024) / ~$13.99M (2025) | $15M permanent (OBBBA) |
| Estate Tax Rate | 40% | 40% |
| Section 7520 Rate | ~5.0-5.6% | Varies monthly |
| QPRT Availability | Yes | Yes |

**OBBBA Update (July 2025):** The One Big Beautiful Bill Act made the estate and gift tax exemption permanent at $15 million per person ($30 million for married couples), eliminating the previously scheduled 2026 sunset.

## Key Benefits

- Transfer residence at discounted gift tax value
- Remove home and future appreciation from estate
- Retain right to live in home during trust term
- Effective use of gift tax exemption
- No income tax consequences during term
- Combines well with other estate planning strategies
- Valuable for estates exceeding $15M exemption

### Valuation Discount Mechanism

**Gift Value = FMV of Home - Retained Interest Value**

The IRS allows a discount because:
1. Grantor retains right to use property for term
2. Beneficiaries receive future interest only
3. Time value of money reduces present value

### Sample QPRT Discounts (2026 Projected)

**Assumptions:** 5.0% Section 7520 rate, $2,000,000 home

| Grantor Age | Term (Years) | Remainder Factor | Gift Value | Discount |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|------------|----------|
| 55 | 10 | 0.5584 | $1,116,800 | 44% |
| 55 | 15 | 0.4173 | $834,600 | 58% |
| 60 | 10 | 0.5327 | $1,065,400 | 47% |
| 60 | 15 | 0.3769 | $753,800 | 62% |
| 65 | 10 | 0.4970 | $994,000 | 50% |
| 65 | 15 | 0.3268 | $653,600 | 67% |
| 70 | 10 | 0.4479 | $895,800 | 55% |

**Key Insight:** Longer terms and higher Section 7520 rates create larger discounts.

- Must be personal residence of grantor
- Can include reasonable surrounding land

### Trust Requirements
- Irrevocable trust
- Grantor must be U.S. citizen or resident

## Client Fit Criteria

### Ideal Candidates

| Characteristic | Why Favorable |
|----------------|---------------|
| Estate exceeds $15M exemption | Need estate tax reduction strategies |
| Own valuable primary or vacation home | Asset suitable for QPRT |
| Good health with reasonable life expectancy | Must survive trust term |
| Want to keep home in family | Passes to children/grandchildren |
| Willing to rent home after term | Can continue living there |
| Ages 55-75 | Balance discount with mortality risk |

### QPRT Suitability Analysis

| Estate Size | Single | Married | QPRT Priority |
|--------------------|--------|---------|---------------|
| Under $15M | Low | Low | Low |
| $15M - $30M | High | Medium | High |
| $30M - $50M | Very High | High | Very High |
| Over $50M | Very High | Very High | Part of comprehensive plan |

### Less Ideal Candidates
- Poor health or short life expectancy
- Need flexibility to sell home
- Home is only major asset
- Cannot afford to pay rent after term
- Very young (term too long) or very old (high mortality risk)

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Analysis

1. **Estate Tax Exposure Assessment**
   - Calculate projected estate value
   - Compare to $15M exemption ($30M married)
   - Determine tax exposure
   - Consider both spouses' exemptions

2. **Property Evaluation**
   - Current fair market value
   - Expected appreciation rate
   - Suitable for long-term family ownership?
   - Any liens or issues?

3. **Term Selection**
   - Balance discount vs. mortality risk
   - Consider grantor's age and health
   - Family circumstances
   - Typical: 10-15 years

4. **7520 Rate Analysis**
   - Higher rates = larger discounts
   - Monitor monthly rates
   - Can choose current or either of 2 prior months

### Phase 2: Creation

1. **Draft Trust Document**
   - Qualified under Treas. Reg. 25.2702-5
   - Specify term precisely
   - Name remainder beneficiaries
   - Include required provisions

2. **Obtain Appraisal**
   - Qualified residential appraisal
   - Document FMV at transfer
   - Support gift tax return position

3. **Execute and Fund**
   - Sign trust document
   - Deed property to trust
   - Record deed with county
   - Update insurance

4. **File Gift Tax Return**
   - Form 709
   - Report discounted gift value
   - Attach appraisal and calculations
   - Allocate GST exemption if appropriate

### Phase 3: During Trust Term

1. **Ongoing Requirements**
   - Grantor continues using as residence
   - Pay all expenses (taxes, insurance, maintenance)
   - No rent paid to trust
   - Maintain trust records

2. **Monitoring**
   - Track term end date
   - Plan for post-term arrangements
   - Consider health changes
   - Annual trust administration

### Phase 4: Term Expiration

1. **If Grantor Survives**
   - Home passes to beneficiaries
   - Grantor can lease at fair market rent
   - Rent payments remove more from estate
   - Success achieved

2. **If Grantor Dies During Term**
   - Home included in estate at FMV
   - No worse than not doing QPRT
   - Gift tax exemption used is restored
   - Consider life insurance hedge

## Post-Term Strategies

### Rent Back Arrangement

**After term ends:**
- Grantor can lease home from beneficiaries
- Must pay fair market rent
- Rent is additional wealth transfer
- Creates income for beneficiaries

**Example:**
- Home FMV: $2,500,000
- Fair market rent: $10,000/month
- Annual rent: $120,000
- Additional estate reduction: $120,000/year (gift-tax-free)

### Sale to Beneficiaries

**Alternative approach:**
- Trust can sell home to beneficiaries
- Consider installment sale
- May allow grantor to continue living there
- Different tax consequences

## Risks & Considerations

### Mortality Risk (Primary Concern)

**If grantor dies during term:**
- Entire FMV included in estate
- No benefit achieved
- Gift tax exemption wasted (but restored)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. Shorter term (higher gift value but lower risk)
2. Life insurance to cover estate tax if fail
3. Consider health carefully
4. Medical underwriting before establishing

### Loss of Control

**After QPRT creation:**
- Cannot sell home without trust termination
- Cannot change beneficiaries easily
- Lost flexibility
- Must live in home (or lose residence status)

### 7520 Rate Risk

**Impact:**
- Lower rates = smaller discount
- Timing matters
- Can select from 3 months

**Current Environment (2025-2026):**
- Rates relatively favorable
- Monitor for changes

### Home Value Changes

**If home declines in value:**
- Paid gift tax on higher value
- No adjustment available
- Still removes from estate at FMV at death

**If home appreciates significantly:**
- QPRT more valuable
- All appreciation excluded
- Excellent outcome

## Case Study

### Scenario
Margaret, age 62 in 2025, owns:
- Primary residence: $5,000,000
- Other assets: $14,000,000
- Total estate: $19,000,000

**Current Analysis (Post-OBBBA):**
- Exemption: $15,000,000
- Taxable estate: $4,000,000
- Estate tax: $1,600,000

### QPRT Strategy

**Structure:**
- Transfer home to 12-year QPRT
- Section 7520 rate: 5.0%
- Remainder factor (age 62, 12 years): 0.4654

**Calculations:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Home FMV | $5,000,000 |
| Remainder factor | 0.4654 |
| Gift value | $2,327,000 |
| Discount | $2,673,000 (53%) |

**Gift Tax:**
- Uses $2,327,000 of exemption
- No gift tax due (within exemption)

### Results if Margaret Survives to Age 74

**Projected Home Value (3% appreciation):**
$5,000,000 × 1.03^12 = $7,128,015

**Estate Comparison (2037):**

| Scenario | Without QPRT | With QPRT |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Home value | $7,128,015 | $0 (excluded) |
| Other assets | $14,000,000 | $14,000,000 |
| Taxable estate | $21,128,015 | $14,000,000 |
| Exemption (est.) | $16,000,000 | $16,000,000 |
| Taxable amount | $5,128,015 | $0 |
| Estate tax (40%) | $2,051,206 | $0 |
| **Savings** | — | **$2,051,206** |

**Additional Benefit:** If Margaret rents from children at $20,000/month for 10 years, additional $2,400,000 transferred.

## QPRT vs. Other Strategies

| Strategy | Discount | Retained Use | Mortality Risk | Complexity |
|----------|----------|--------------|----------------|------------|
| QPRT | 40-70% | Yes (term) | High | Medium |
| Direct Gift | None | No | None | Low |
| Sale to IDGT | Possible | No | Low | High |
| FLP with Residence | Possible | Maybe | Low | High |
| Do Nothing | N/A | Yes | N/A | None |
