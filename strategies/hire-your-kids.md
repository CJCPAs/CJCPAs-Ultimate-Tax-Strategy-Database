# Hire Your Kids Strategy

## Overview

Employing your children in a legitimate family business provides powerful tax benefits. When structured properly, wages paid to children are deductible by the business while potentially being tax-free to the child, creating significant family tax savings. This strategy also teaches financial responsibility and work ethic.

## Key Benefits

- Business deduction for wages paid
- Children's income often taxed at 0% (up to standard deduction)
- No FICA taxes for children under 18 in sole proprietorship/partnership
- Shifts income from high bracket parent to low/zero bracket child
- Funds child's Roth IRA contributions
- Teaches financial literacy and work habits

## Tax Savings Summary

| Parent's Bracket | Child's Wages | Parent Tax Savings | Child Tax | Net Family Savings |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 37% | $14,600 | $5,402 | $0 | $5,402 |
| 35% | $14,600 | $5,110 | $0 | $5,110 |
| 32% | $14,600 | $4,672 | $0 | $4,672 |
| 24% | $14,600 | $3,504 | $0 | $3,504 |

*2024 figures; standard deduction = $14,600*

## Requirements

### Legitimate Employment Requirements
- **Real work**: Child must perform actual services
- **Age-appropriate tasks**: Work must be suitable for child's age
- **Reasonable compensation**: Pay must match market rate for work
- **Documentation**: Time records and job descriptions required

### Entity-Specific Rules

#### Sole Proprietorship / Single-Member LLC (Disregarded)
- **No FICA** for children under 18
- **No FUTA** for children under 21
- Most tax-advantaged structure for this strategy

#### Partnership (Both Parents Partners)
- Same FICA/FUTA exemptions as sole proprietorship
- Must be owned entirely by parents

#### S Corporation or C Corporation
- **Full FICA applies** regardless of child's age
- Still provides income shifting benefits
- Less advantageous than disregarded entity

### Age Considerations

| Age Range | Typical Tasks | Documentation Level |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| 7-12 | Office cleaning, filing, simple computer tasks, acting/modeling | Higher scrutiny expected |
| 13-15 | Data entry, social media, inventory, customer service | Standard documentation |
| 16-17 | Administrative work, marketing, skilled tasks | Normal employment standards |
| 18+ | Any legitimate job function | Standard employee treatment |

## Client Fit Criteria

### Ideal Candidates
- Sole proprietors or partners with children ages 7-17
- Businesses with legitimate tasks for children
- Parents in high tax brackets (32%+)

3. **Annual Target**

   - W-4 form completed
   - I-9 form (for 18+)

2. **Implementation**
   - Open custodial Roth IRA

   - Tax-free growth for decades

## Risks & Considerations

### Audit Risk Factors
- **Unreasonable wages**: Paying above market rate
- **No actual work**: Payments without services
- **Poor documentation**: Missing time records
- **Age-inappropriate tasks**: Work beyond child's capability

### Common Mistakes
- Paying in cash without records
- No job descriptions
- Inconsistent time tracking
- Wages exceeding reasonable amount
- Work not actually performed

### Child Labor Law Compliance
- Federal FLSA restrictions on hours and occupations
- State laws may be more restrictive
- Parental exemption for family business
- Hazardous occupation restrictions apply

### Kiddie Tax Considerations
- Unearned income over $2,500 taxed at parent's rate
- Earned income not subject to kiddie tax
- Ensure wages are for actual work performed
