# Section 199A Maximization

## Overview

Section 199A provides a deduction of up to 20% of Qualified Business Income (QBI) from pass-through entities and sole proprietorships. Proper planning can maximize this deduction, potentially saving taxpayers thousands in federal income tax.

## Key Benefits

- Up to 20% deduction on qualified business income
- Effective tax rate reduction from 37% to 29.6% for top earners
- Available to S corporations, partnerships, LLCs, and sole proprietors
- Stacks with other deductions and strategies

## Deduction Calculation

### Basic Calculation
**QBI Deduction = Lesser of:**
1. 20% of QBI, or
2. Greater of:
   - 50% of W-2 wages paid, or
   - 25% of W-2 wages + 2.5% of UBIA (unadjusted basis of qualified property)

### Taxable Income Thresholds (2024)

| Filing Status | Full Deduction Below | Phase-out Range | Fully Limited Above |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Single | $182,100 | $182,100 - $232,100 | $232,100 |
| MFJ | $364,200 | $364,200 - $464,200 | $464,200 |

## Requirements

### Qualified Business Income
- Income from U.S. trade or business
- Excludes investment income (capital gains, dividends, interest)
- Excludes reasonable compensation to S corp shareholders
- Excludes guaranteed payments to partners

### Specified Service Trade or Business (SSTB) Rules
SSTBs face additional limitations above income thresholds:
- Health, law, accounting, consulting
- Athletics, financial services, brokerage
- Any trade where principal asset is owner reputation

### W-2 Wage and UBIA Requirements
Above threshold, deduction limited by:
- W-2 wages paid by business
- Qualified property basis (UBIA)

## Client Fit Criteria

### Ideal Candidates for Maximization
- Pass-through business owners with $100,000+ QBI
- Taxpayers below SSTB threshold with high QBI
- Real estate investors with rental income
- Business owners willing to restructure

### Good Candidates
- S corporation shareholders
- Partnership and LLC members
- Sole proprietors with employees
- Real estate operating businesses

### Challenging Scenarios
- High-income SSTB owners (limited or no deduction)
- Taxpayers with primarily investment income
- Businesses with no W-2 wages and minimal property

## Implementation Steps

### Strategy 1: Income Threshold Management

1. **Income Assessment**
   - Calculate projected taxable income
   - Identify proximity to threshold amounts
   - Evaluate income deferral/acceleration opportunities

2. **Threshold Optimization**
   - Maximize retirement contributions to reduce taxable income
   - Use charitable strategies (bunching, DAFs)
   - Time major transactions strategically
   - Consider installment sales

3. **Implementation**
   - Establish or maximize retirement plans
   - Set up Donor Advised Fund if charitable bunching helpful
   - Time business income/deductions appropriately

### Strategy 2: W-2 Wage Optimization

1. **Wage Analysis**
   - Calculate 50% W-2 wage limitation
   - Compare to 25% W-2 + 2.5% UBIA alternative
   - Identify optimal wage level

2. **Wage Planning**
   - Ensure S corporation reasonable compensation is sufficient
   - Consider increasing wages slightly above minimum
   - Time year-end bonuses strategically

3. **Calculation Example**
   - QBI: $500,000
   - W-2 wages: $100,000
   - 20% of QBI: $100,000
   - 50% of W-2: $50,000
   - **Deduction limited to $50,000**

   After increasing wages to $200,000:
   - 50% of W-2: $100,000
   - **Full $100,000 deduction now available**

### Strategy 3: Property Basis (UBIA) Optimization

1. **Property Assessment**
   - Identify all qualified property in the business
   - Calculate UBIA for each asset
   - Determine years remaining in depreciable period

2. **UBIA Planning**
   - Acquire property before placed-in-service deadline
   - Consider purchasing vs. leasing equipment
   - Time asset acquisitions strategically

3. **Calculation Mechanics**
   - UBIA = Original cost basis (not reduced for depreciation)
   - Property qualifies through later of:
     - 10 years after placed in service, or
     - End of last full depreciation year

### Strategy 4: Business Restructuring

1. **Entity Evaluation**
   - Assess current entity structure
   - Identify SSTB components vs. non-SSTB
   - Evaluate spin-off opportunities

2. **Restructuring Options**
   - Separate SSTB from non-SSTB activities
   - Create management company for non-SSTB income
   - Establish real estate holding company

3. **Implementation Considerations**
   - De minimis rules: <10% SSTB revenue (or 5% if gross >$25M)
   - Arm's length pricing between entities
   - Economic substance requirements
   - Anti-abuse rules awareness

### Strategy 5: Real Estate Rental Safe Harbor

1. **Safe Harbor Requirements**
   - 250+ hours of rental services annually
   - Maintain contemporaneous records
   - Separate books for each rental enterprise
   - No triple net leases

2. **Qualifying Activities**
   - Advertising and marketing
   - Tenant screening and leasing
   - Rent collection
   - Property management supervision
   - Repairs and maintenance oversight

3. **Documentation**
   - Time logs with dates, hours, activities
   - Property-by-property tracking
   - Annual certification with tax return

## Risks & Considerations

### SSTB Classification Risk
- IRS examines actual activities, not labels
- "Consulting" broadly defined
- Reputation and skill analysis complex
- Restructuring must have substance

### Anti-Abuse Rules
- Cracking (separating SSTBs) scrutinized
- Related party transactions reviewed
- Same ownership attribution rules
- Economic substance required

### Aggregation Complexity
- Optional aggregation of businesses
- Once aggregated, consistently treated
- Election made annually
- Common ownership required (50%+)

### State Conformity Issues
- Not all states follow Section 199A
- State add-backs may apply
- Calculate federal and state separately

## Case Study

### Scenario
Medical practice group with $1,000,000 combined QBI. Three physician partners. Taxable income: $400,000 each (MFJ).

### Without Planning
- SSTB rules apply above threshold
- Deduction phases out completely
- **199A deduction: $0**

### With Strategic Planning

**Step 1: Separate Non-SSTB Activities**
- Create medical office building LLC (real estate)
- Establish equipment leasing company
- Non-SSTB income: $200,000 (rent + equipment lease)

**Step 2: Optimize Structure**
- Medical practice pays arm's length rent
- Equipment lease at market rates
- Proper documentation maintained

**Step 3: Calculate Results**
- SSTB QBI: $800,000 (limited above threshold)
- Non-SSTB QBI: $200,000 (fully eligible)
- Non-SSTB deduction: $200,000 × 20% = $40,000
- Assuming adequate W-2 wages/UBIA

**Annual Tax Savings**: $40,000 × 37% = $14,800
