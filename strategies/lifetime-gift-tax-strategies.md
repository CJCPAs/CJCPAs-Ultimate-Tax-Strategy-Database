# Lifetime Gift Tax Strategies

## Overview

Lifetime gift tax strategies enable taxpayers to transfer wealth to family members and beneficiaries during their lifetime while minimizing or eliminating gift and estate taxes. Strategic use of annual exclusions, the lifetime exemption, and various gifting techniques can transfer millions of dollars tax-free across generations.

## Key Benefits

- Transfer wealth free of gift and estate taxes
- Remove future appreciation from taxable estate
- Use annual exclusions that expire if not utilized
- Leverage lifetime exemption during periods of high exemption amounts
- Reduce estate size and potential estate tax liability
- Provide for family members during donor's lifetime
- Witness the benefit of gifts to loved ones

## Gift Tax Fundamentals

### Annual Exclusion Gifts

| Year | Per-Donee Exclusion | Married Couple (Split Gifts) |
|------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| 2024 | $18,000 | $36,000 |
| 2025 | $19,000 | $38,000 |

**Key Features:**
- Unlimited number of donees
- No gift tax return required (unless split gifts)
- Resets annually (use it or lose it)
- Present interest requirement

### Lifetime Gift/Estate Tax Exemption (Post-OBBBA)

| Year | Individual Exemption | Married Couple |
|------|---------------------|----------------|
| 2024 | $13.61 million | $27.22 million |
| 2025+ | **$15.00 million** | **$30.00 million** |

**OBBBA Update**: The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (2025) permanently set the estate/gift/GST exemption at $15 million per person ($30 million for married couples). The anticipated TCJA sunset did not occur.

### Gift Tax Rates

- Maximum gift tax rate: 40%
- Unified with estate tax
- Exemption amount shared between lifetime gifts and estate

## Requirements

### Present Interest Requirement
- Annual exclusion gifts must be "present interest"
- Donee must have immediate right to use, possess, or enjoy
- Future interests do not qualify for annual exclusion
- Crummey powers can convert future to present interest

### Gift Tax Return (Form 709)
Required when:
- Gifts exceed annual exclusion amount
- Gift splitting with spouse elected
- Gifts of future interests
- Gifts to 529 plans using 5-year averaging

### Valuation Requirements
- Fair market value at date of gift
- Qualified appraisals for non-cash gifts over $5,000
- Discounts may apply for lack of marketability/control
- Special valuation rules for certain transfers (Chapter 14)

## Client Fit Criteria

### Ideal Candidates
- High-net-worth individuals with estates exceeding $15M exemption
- Those with appreciating assets
- Parents/grandparents wanting to help next generation
- Business owners with succession planning needs
- Individuals with excess cash flow
- Those wanting to transfer wealth while alive to witness benefits

### Gift Timing Considerations
- Gift during low-value periods (market dips)
- Gift before anticipated appreciation
- Gift to shift income to lower-bracket beneficiaries
- Gift when donor's income tax bracket is lower than donee's

## Implementation Strategies

### Strategy 1: Annual Exclusion Program

**Systematic Annual Gifting:**

1. **Family Mapping**
   - Identify all potential donees
   - Include children, grandchildren, in-laws
   - Consider trusts as separate donees

2. **Gift Calculation**
   - Single donor: $18,000 × number of donees
   - Married couple: $36,000 × number of donees
   - Example: Married couple with 4 children and 8 grandchildren
     - Annual transfer: $36,000 × 12 = $432,000/year
     - 10-year transfer: $4.32 million (tax-free)

3. **Gift Methods**
   - Direct cash transfers
   - Pay expenses directly
   - Fund accounts (529, UTMA)
   - Gift appreciated securities

### Strategy 2: Exemption Utilization

**Large Gift Planning:**

1. **Exemption Analysis**
   - Calculate current estate value
   - Project estate at death
   - Determine excess over exemption
   - Consider state estate tax thresholds

2. **Gift Sizing**
   - Use exemption for large transfers strategically
   - Focus on high-growth assets
   - Consider "clawback" rules (none under current law)
   - $15M permanent exemption provides flexibility

3. **Asset Selection**
   - Appreciating assets maximize benefit
   - S corporation stock
   - LLC/partnership interests
   - Real estate
   - Growth stocks

### Strategy 3: Tuition and Medical Exclusions

**Unlimited Tax-Free Transfers:**

- **Education**: Pay tuition directly to institution
  - Must be direct payment
  - Tuition only (not room, board, books)
  - Any level of education qualifies
  - No limit on amount

- **Medical**: Pay medical expenses directly to provider
  - Must be direct payment to provider
  - Includes insurance premiums
  - Qualifies for any person
  - No limit on amount

**Planning Note**: These are IN ADDITION to annual exclusion

### Strategy 4: Gift Splitting

**Spousal Gift Splitting:**

1. **Requirements**
   - Both spouses must consent
   - Both must be U.S. citizens or residents
   - Election on Form 709
   - Applies to all gifts for the year

2. **Benefits**
   - Double annual exclusion ($36,000)
   - Access both spouses' lifetime exemption
   - Useful when one spouse owns most assets

3. **Cautions**
   - Both spouses must file Form 709
   - Consent is irrevocable for that year
   - May expose consenting spouse to gift tax

### Strategy 5: 529 Plan Front-Loading

**5-Year Gift Tax Averaging:**

1. **Mechanics**
   - Contribute up to 5 years of annual exclusions at once
   - Elect 5-year averaging on Form 709
   - $90,000 single / $180,000 married couple (2024)

2. **Benefits**
   - Immediate removal from estate
   - Tax-free growth for education
   - Donor retains control
   - Can change beneficiaries

3. **Considerations**
   - No additional gifts to same beneficiary for 5 years
   - Pro-rata inclusion if donor dies within 5 years
   - State tax deductions may be limited

### Strategy 6: Net Gift Technique

**Donee Pays Gift Tax:**

1. **Structure**
   - Gift conditioned on donee paying gift tax
   - Reduces effective gift amount
   - Useful when exemption exhausted

2. **Calculation**
   ```
   Net Gift = Gross Gift - Gift Tax
   Gift Tax = (Net Gift) × Tax Rate ÷ (1 + Tax Rate)
   ```

3. **Example**
   - Gross gift: $1,000,000
   - Tax rate: 40%
   - Gift tax: $1,000,000 × 0.40 ÷ 1.40 = $285,714
   - Net gift: $714,286

### Strategy 7: Basis Planning Considerations

**Gift vs. Inheritance Trade-off:**

| Transfer Method | Recipient's Basis | Best For |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------|
| Gift | Carryover (donor's basis) | Low-basis assets if no sale planned |
| Inheritance | Stepped-up to FMV | High-appreciation, low-basis assets |

**Planning Implications:**
- Don't gift highly appreciated assets if sale imminent
- Consider "swap" power in grantor trusts
- Loss assets: gift to harvest loss, or hold for step-down avoidance

## Risks & Considerations

### Gift Tax Risks
- Gifts exceeding exemption trigger 40% tax
- Gift tax due April 15 of following year
- Donor liable for gift tax (not donee)
- State gift taxes in some states (CT, MN)

### Valuation Risks
- IRS may challenge valuations
- Adequate disclosure starts statute of limitations
- Qualified appraisals required for large non-cash gifts
- Penalties for substantial undervaluation

### Control Risks
- Completed gifts are irrevocable
- Cannot recover gifted assets
- Donee has full control
- May affect donor's financial security

### Medicaid Planning Risks
- 5-year lookback period for Medicaid
- Gifts may create penalty period
- Consider long-term care needs before gifting

### Exemption Stability (Post-OBBBA)
- Exemption now permanently set at $15M per person
- No sunset concerns—long-term planning possible
- Couples have $30M combined permanent exemption
- Focus can shift from urgency to strategic optimization

## Case Study

### Scenario
Robert and Sandra, both age 65, have a $45 million estate. They have 3 children and 6 grandchildren. They want to minimize estate taxes while maintaining financial security.

### Current Situation (Post-OBBBA)
- Estate: $45 million
- 2025+ exemption: $30 million (combined, permanent)
- Taxable estate without planning: $15 million
- Projected estate tax (no planning): ~$6 million

### Gifting Strategy

**Phase 1: Annual Exclusion Program**
- 9 beneficiaries × $38,000 = $342,000/year
- 10-year transfer: $3.42 million

**Phase 2: 529 Front-Loading**
- 6 grandchildren × $190,000 = $1,140,000
- Immediate removal from estate

**Phase 3: Strategic Exemption Gifts**
- Gift $10 million to irrevocable trust
- Uses $10M of combined $30M exemption
- Removes future appreciation from estate

### Results
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Starting estate | $45,000,000 |
| Annual exclusion gifts (10 years) | ($3,420,000) |
| 529 contributions | ($1,140,000) |
| Exemption gifts to trust | ($10,000,000) |
| Remaining estate (before growth) | $30,440,000 |
| Permanent combined exemption | $30,000,000 |
| Projected taxable estate | ~$440,000 |
| Estate tax saved | ~$5,800,000+ |

**Additional Benefits:**
- Trust appreciation (assumed 7% annually) excluded
- $10M growing to $19.7M over 10 years = $9.7M additional exclusion
