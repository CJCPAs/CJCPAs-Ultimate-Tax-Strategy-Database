# Split-Dollar Life Insurance

## Overview

Split-dollar life insurance is an arrangement where two parties (typically an employer and employee, or a family member and trust) share the costs, benefits, and ownership of a life insurance policy. These arrangements can provide substantial tax benefits for executive compensation and estate planning. The IRS provides two regulatory regimes—economic benefit and loan—each with different tax consequences.

## Effective Dates & Key Law Changes

| Provision | Current Law | 2026 and Beyond |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Economic Benefit Regime | Active | No change expected |
| Loan Regime | Active | No change expected |
| AFR Rates | Monthly published | Monthly published |
| Estate Tax Exemption | ~$13.99M (2025) | ~$7M (TCJA sunset) |
| Gift Tax Annual Exclusion | $19,000 (2025) | Indexed |
| Section 409A | May apply | May apply |

**2026 Planning Alert:** Split-dollar arrangements in estate planning become MORE valuable after the exemption drops, as they can transfer significant value outside the estate with minimal gift tax.

## Types of Split-Dollar Arrangements

### Endorsement vs. Collateral Assignment

| Method | Owner | Beneficiary Control |
|--------|-------|---------------------|
| **Endorsement** | Employer/Donor | Employer owns, endorses portion to employee |
| **Collateral Assignment** | Employee/Trust | Employee owns, assigns collateral interest |

## Economic Benefit Regime

### How It Works

1. Employer/donor owns the policy
2. Employee/beneficiary receives death benefit protection
3. Employee taxed annually on "economic benefit"
4. Economic benefit = cost of term insurance protection

### Measuring Economic Benefit

**Use lower of:**
- IRS Table 2001 rates, OR
- Insurer's published one-year term rates (if available)

**Table 2001 Sample Rates (per $1,000):**

| Age | Monthly Rate |
|-----|-------------|
| 35 | $0.09 |
| 45 | $0.15 |
| 55 | $0.43 |
| 65 | $1.27 |
| 70 | $2.06 |
| 75 | $3.76 |

### Economic Benefit Calculation

**Example:**
| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Death benefit | $5,000,000 |
| Cash value (employer's interest) | $500,000 |
| Net amount at risk | $4,500,000 |
| Insured's age | 55 |
| Table 2001 rate | $0.43/$1,000/month |
| **Annual economic benefit** | **$23,220** |

($4,500,000 / $1,000 × $0.43 × 12 = $23,220)

### Advantages of Economic Benefit

| Advantage | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Lower current cost (older insureds) | Table 2001 rates < actual cost |
| Simple taxation | Annual income inclusion |
| Estate planning utility | Can structure to keep out of estate |
| No loan repayment | No debt to manage |

### Disadvantages

| Disadvantage | Explanation |
|--------------|-------------|
| Increasing cost | Rates increase with age |
| No ownership | Employee doesn't own policy |
| Employer control | Policy subject to employer decisions |
| Death benefit taxation | May be taxable to beneficiary |

## Loan Regime

### How It Works

1. Employee/trust owns the policy
2. Employer/donor "lends" premium payments
3. Interest charged at AFR (or imputed if below-market)
4. Loans repaid from death benefit or policy value

### Interest Requirements

**Adequate Interest (AFR):**
- Must charge at least AFR
- Otherwise, imputed interest under Section 7872
- Below-market loan rules apply

**AFR Rates (Example - December 2024):**
| Term | Annual | Monthly |
|------|--------|---------|
| Short-term (≤3 years) | 4.55% | 4.47% |
| Mid-term (3-9 years) | 4.25% | 4.18% |
| Long-term (>9 years) | 4.45% | 4.37% |

### Taxation Under Loan Regime

**If Adequate Interest Charged:**
- No current income to employee
- Interest payments deductible (potentially)
- Loans repaid at termination

**If Below-Market or Interest-Free:**
- Imputed interest = taxable compensation
- Employer deemed to pay interest
- Employee deemed to receive and pay back

### Advantages of Loan Regime

| Advantage | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Ownership | Employee/trust owns policy |
| Cash value access | Owner can access policy value |
| Potential for interest deduction | If properly structured |
| Lower cost (younger insureds) | AFR rates vs. Table 2001 |

### Disadvantages

| Disadvantage | Explanation |
|--------------|-------------|
| Debt accumulation | Loan balance grows |
| Interest payments | Must pay or impute |
| Complexity | More moving parts |
| Section 409A risk | May be deferred compensation |

## Employment-Based Split-Dollar

### Executive Compensation Application

**Common Structure:**
1. Company pays premiums on executive's policy
2. Company entitled to recover premiums (or cash value)
3. Executive's family receives excess death benefit
4. Provides significant benefit with limited current tax

### Design Considerations

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| Regime choice | Economic benefit vs. loan |
| Rollout | Current compensation vs. future benefit |
| Exit provisions | What happens at termination? |
| Section 409A | Avoid deferred comp treatment |
| Reasonableness | Part of overall compensation analysis |

### Section 409A Concerns

**Split-dollar may trigger 409A if:**
- Provides deferred compensation
- Not properly structured
- Results in additional 20% tax + interest

**Safe harbors:**
- Economic benefit regime (generally safe)
- Loan regime with current taxation
- Termination within short period

## Estate Planning Split-Dollar

### Private Split-Dollar (Family)

**Structure:**
1. ILIT (Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust) owns policy
2. Grantor "loans" premiums to trust
3. Death benefit passes estate-tax-free to trust
4. Loan repaid from death benefit

### Benefits for Estate Planning

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Leverage gift exemption | Interest-only transfers minimal value |
| Estate tax exclusion | Death benefit outside estate |
| Dynasty trust funding | Can fund multi-generational trust |
| Avoid Crummey letters | Loan, not gift (no Crummey needed) |

### Private Split-Dollar Example

**$10,000,000 Policy:**

| Year | Premium | Loan Balance | Interest (4.5%) | Gift Tax Value |
|------|---------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | $200,000 | $200,000 | $9,000 | $9,000 |
| 5 | $200,000 | $1,000,000 | $45,000 | $45,000 |
| 10 | $200,000 | $2,000,000 | $90,000 | $90,000 |
| 15 | $200,000 | $3,000,000 | $135,000 | $135,000 |
| 20 | $200,000 | $4,000,000 | $180,000 | $180,000 |

**At death (year 20):**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Death benefit | $10,000,000 |
| Loan repayment | ($4,000,000) |
| **To family (estate-tax-free)** | **$6,000,000** |
| Total gifts made | ~$1,000,000 |
| Estate tax saved (40%) | $4,000,000 |

### Comparison: Split-Dollar vs. Traditional ILIT

| Factor | Split-Dollar | Traditional ILIT |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| Annual gifts needed | Interest only | Full premium |
| Crummey notices | Not needed | Required |
| Gift tax exposure | Lower | Higher |
| Complexity | Higher | Lower |
| Loan repayment | Required | None |
| Flexibility | High | Moderate |

## Equity Split-Dollar

### Definition

Equity split-dollar allows the employee/trust to participate in cash value growth, not just death benefit.

### IRS Position

**Notice 2002-8 and Regulations:**
- Equity arrangements have special rules
- "Equity" = right to cash value in excess of premiums
- May trigger additional income

### Tax Treatment

| Arrangement | Tax Result |
|-------------|------------|
| Non-equity | Only economic benefit/interest taxed |
| Equity | May have additional income on termination |
| Switch-dollar | Converting between regimes |

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Design

   - Document source of funds

3. **Monitor**
   - Policy performance
   - Interest rates
   - Tax law changes

## Case Study

### Scenario: Estate Planning Split-Dollar

**The Johnsons:**
- Net worth: $25,000,000
- Used exemptions: $27,000,000 (both spouses)
- Need: $10,000,000 life insurance for estate taxes
- Challenge: Don't want to make $300,000/year gifts

### Traditional ILIT Approach

| Year | Premium (Gift) | Cumulative Gifts |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| 1-20 | $300,000/year | $6,000,000 |

- Requires annual Crummey notices
- Uses significant gift exclusions
- May generate gift tax (if over annual exclusion × beneficiaries)

### Private Split-Dollar Approach (Loan Regime)

**Structure:**
- ILIT owns $10M policy
- Johnsons loan premiums to ILIT
- Interest-only (4.5% AFR)

| Year | Premium | Loan Balance | Interest/Gift |
|------|---------|--------------|---------------|
| 1 | $300,000 | $300,000 | $13,500 |
| 10 | $300,000 | $3,000,000 | $135,000 |
| 20 | $300,000 | $6,000,000 | $270,000 |

**Comparison:**
| Factor | Traditional | Split-Dollar |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Annual gift | $300,000 | $13,500-$270,000 |
| Crummey notices | Yes | No |
| Total "transfers" | $6,000,000 | ~$2,000,000 |
| Death benefit to family | $10,000,000 | $4,000,000* |
| Estate tax on proceeds | $0 | $0 |

*After loan repayment. Can design for full repayment from other sources.

### Result

Split-dollar allows transfer of $4M+ estate-tax-free while only making ~$2M in economic gifts (interest payments). Traditional ILIT would require $6M in direct gifts.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Wrong regime selection | Suboptimal taxation | Analyze both regimes |
| Below-market interest | Imputed income | Use AFR or higher |
| Section 409A violation | 20% penalty + interest | Proper structuring |
| No written agreement | IRS recharacterization | Document everything |
| Policy lapses | Lost benefits, potential tax | Monitor performance |
| Improper rollout | Unexpected taxation | Plan termination carefully |
