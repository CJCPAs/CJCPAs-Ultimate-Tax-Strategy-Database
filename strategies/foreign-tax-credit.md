# Foreign Tax Credit

## Overview

The Foreign Tax Credit (FTC) allows U.S. taxpayers to reduce their federal income tax liability by the amount of income taxes paid or accrued to foreign countries. Since U.S. citizens and residents are taxed on worldwide income, the FTC prevents double taxation of foreign-source income. Proper planning can maximize credit utilization and minimize overall tax burden.

## Key Benefits

- Eliminates or reduces double taxation
- Dollar-for-dollar reduction in U.S. tax
- Carryback (1 year) and carryforward (10 years) of excess credits
- Available for both individual and business taxpayers
- Can choose credit or deduction annually
- Covers income, war profits, and excess profits taxes

│  French business income: $100,000                               │
│  French tax (25%): $25,000                                      │
│  U.S. tax before credit: $37,000                                │
│  Foreign Tax Credit: ($25,000)                                  │
│  Net U.S. tax: $12,000                                          │
│                                                                  │
│  Total tax paid: $25,000 (FR) + $12,000 (US) = $37,000         │
│  (Same as if all income were U.S. source)                       │
│                                                                  │

### Credit vs. Deduction

| Factor | Credit | Deduction |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Tax benefit | Dollar-for-dollar | Reduces taxable income |
| Value at 37% rate | 100 cents per dollar | 37 cents per dollar |
| Form required | 1116 | Schedule A (or Schedule C/F) |
| Limitation | Yes (complex) | No |
| Carryover | Yes | No |
| **Usually better** | ✓ | Rarely |

**When deduction might be better:**
- Low foreign taxes
- High domestic losses
- AMT situation
- Simplification preference

## FTC Limitation

### The Limitation Formula

```
FTC Limit = U.S. Tax × (Foreign Source Taxable Income / Worldwide Taxable Income)
```

**Purpose:** Prevent foreign tax credit from offsetting tax on U.S.-source income

### Limitation Example

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Worldwide taxable income | $500,000 |
| Foreign source income | $100,000 |
| U.S. source income | $400,000 |
| Total U.S. tax (before credits) | $150,000 |
| **FTC Limitation** | $150,000 × ($100,000/$500,000) = **$30,000** |

**If foreign tax paid was $35,000:**
- Credit allowed: $30,000 (limited)
- Excess credit: $5,000 (carryback/forward)

### Separate Baskets

**FTC calculated separately for each "basket" (category):**

| Basket | Types of Income |
|--------|-----------------|
| General | Most business income, royalties, services |
| Passive | Dividends, interest, rents, royalties (not active) |
| GILTI | Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income |
| Foreign Branch | Income from foreign branches |
| Section 901(j) | Income from sanctioned countries |

**No cross-crediting between baskets**

## Types of Creditable Taxes

### Creditable Foreign Taxes

| Tax Type | Creditable? |
|----------|-------------|
| Income tax | Yes |
| War profits tax | Yes |
| Excess profits tax | Yes |
| In-lieu-of taxes | Yes (if qualifies) |
| Provincial/local income taxes | Yes |

### Non-Creditable Taxes

| Tax Type | Creditable? |
|----------|-------------|
| Value Added Tax (VAT) | No (may be business expense) |
| Sales tax | No |
| Property tax | No |
| Social Security (some) | No |
| Wealth tax | No |
| Inheritance/estate tax | No |

### Creditable Tax Requirements

**Must be:**
1. A tax (not a fee or penalty)
2. Imposed on taxpayer
3. A compulsory payment to a foreign government
4. Based on realized income

## Requirements

### Documentation Requirements

**For Foreign Tax Credit:**
- Form 1116 (individual)
- Form 1118 (corporation)
- Evidence of foreign tax paid/accrued
- Foreign tax statements or returns
- Calculation of foreign source income

### $300/$600 Exception

**Simplified treatment if:**
- Total foreign taxes ≤ $300 (single) or $600 (MFJ)
- All from qualified passive income
- All shown on Form 1099 or payee statements
- No carryforward needed

**Can claim credit without Form 1116**

### Paid vs. Accrued Method

| Method | Description | When Used |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Cash (Paid) | Credit when actually paid | Default for individuals |
| Accrual | Credit when tax becomes fixed/determinable | Election required |

**Election to accrue:**
- Binding for all subsequent years
- Useful for timing optimization
- Must apply to all foreign taxes

## Planning Strategies

### Strategy 1: Timing Optimization

**Accelerate or defer foreign income to match limitation:**
- High U.S. income year → Good year for FTC
- Low U.S. income year → May have excess FTC
- Time recognition to maximize credit utilization

### Strategy 2: Carryback/Carryforward Management

**Excess FTC Carryover Rules:**
- 1-year carryback
- 10-year carryforward
- Use oldest credits first

**Planning:**
- Project future FTC limitation
- Avoid losing expiring credits
- Consider acceleration of foreign income

### Strategy 3: Source Rule Planning

**Income Sourcing:**
| Income Type | Source Rule |
|-------------|-------------|
| Salary | Where services performed |
| Interest | Residence of payer |
| Dividends | Incorporation location |
| Rent | Location of property |
| Royalties | Where used |
| Capital gains | Residence of seller |

**Can sometimes influence sourcing through planning**

### Strategy 4: High-Tax Kickout Election

**For passive basket income:**
- If foreign tax rate > highest U.S. rate
- Can elect to treat as general basket
- Useful to avoid trapped credits in passive basket

### Strategy 5: Treaty Benefits

**Tax treaties may provide:**
- Reduced withholding rates
- Favorable sourcing rules
- Tie-breaker rules
- Specific credit provisions

**Always check applicable treaty**

## Special Situations

### Foreign Tax on U.S. Source Income

**Example:** Foreign withholding on U.S. dividend
- May reduce FTC limitation
- Treaty may provide relief
- Document carefully

### AMT Foreign Tax Credit

**Separate calculation:**
- 90% limitation for AMT FTC
- May create AMT FTC carryforward
- Different rules than regular tax

### Foreign Taxes in Retirement Accounts

**In IRA or 401(k):**
- Cannot claim FTC (account is tax-deferred)
- Consider account location planning
- Foreign investments in taxable accounts

### Pass-Through Entities

**Partnerships and S Corps:**
- FTC flows through to owners
- Reported on Schedule K-1
- Each partner/shareholder claims credit
- Basis and allocation rules apply

## Case Study

### Scenario
Sarah, a U.S. citizen, has the following income:
- U.S. salary: $200,000
- UK consulting income: $100,000 (UK tax: $35,000)
- German dividend: $20,000 (withholding: $5,000)

### FTC Calculation

**Step 1: Calculate limitation**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Total worldwide income | $320,000 |
| Foreign source income | $120,000 |
| Total U.S. tax (before FTC) | $85,000 |
| FTC Limitation | $85,000 × ($120,000/$320,000) = $31,875 |

**Step 2: Separate baskets**
| Basket | Foreign Income | Foreign Tax |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| General (consulting) | $100,000 | $35,000 |
| Passive (dividend) | $20,000 | $5,000 |

**Step 3: Calculate credit by basket**

*General Basket:*
- Limitation: $85,000 × ($100,000/$320,000) = $26,562
- Foreign tax: $35,000
- Credit allowed: $26,562
- Excess (carryover): $8,438

*Passive Basket:*
- Limitation: $85,000 × ($20,000/$320,000) = $5,313
- Foreign tax: $5,000
- Credit allowed: $5,000
- No excess

**Step 4: Total credit**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| U.S. tax before credits | $85,000 |
| General basket FTC | ($26,562) |
| Passive basket FTC | ($5,000) |
| **Net U.S. tax** | **$53,438** |

**Total Tax Paid:**
- UK: $35,000
- Germany: $5,000
- U.S.: $53,438
- Total: $93,438

**Carryover:** $8,438 general basket excess (10-year carryforward)

## Common Errors to Avoid

| Error | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| Not separating baskets | Incorrect limitation |
| Missing creditable taxes | Lost benefit |
| Claiming non-creditable taxes | IRS adjustment |
| Poor documentation | Disallowed credits |
| Missing carryover | Lost credits |
| Wrong timing method | Audit risk |
