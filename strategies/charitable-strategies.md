# Part 1: Charitable Remainder Trusts (CRTs)

## Overview

A Charitable Remainder Trust is an irrevocable trust that provides income to the donor (or other beneficiaries) for life or a term of years, with the remainder going to charity. CRTs offer income tax deductions, capital gains deferral, and estate planning benefits.

## Types of CRTs

### Charitable Remainder Annuity Trust (CRAT)
- Fixed annuity payment each year
- No additional contributions allowed
- Payment: 5-50% of initial value annually
- Trust must have >5% probability of remainder to charity

### Charitable Remainder Unitrust (CRUT)
- Variable payment based on annual trust value
- Additional contributions permitted
- Payment: 5-50% of annual trust value
- More common than CRAT

### CRUT Variations
| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Standard CRUT | Fixed percentage of annual value | Steady income needs |
| Net Income CRUT (NICRUT) | Lesser of stated % or trust income | Volatile assets |
| Net Income + Makeup CRUT (NIMCRUT) | Catch-up for years with low income | Retirement planning |
| Flip CRUT | NIMCRUT that "flips" to standard upon trigger | Illiquid asset sales |

## CRT Requirements

# Part 2: Donor Advised Funds (DAFs)

# Part 3: Charitable Bunching

## Overview

Charitable bunching involves concentrating multiple years of charitable contributions into a single tax year to exceed the standard deduction threshold, then taking the standard deduction in alternate years. This strategy maximizes the tax benefit of charitable giving.

## How Bunching Works

### Without Bunching (Annual $15,000 Gifts)
| Year | Charitable Gift | Standard Deduction | Itemized Deductions | Benefit |
|------|----------------:|-------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|
| 2024 | $15,000 | $29,200 | $25,000 | Standard used |
| 2025 | $15,000 | $29,200 | $25,000 | Standard used |
| 2026 | $15,000 | $29,200 | $25,000 | Standard used |
| **Total** | **$45,000** | | | **$0 charity benefit** |

### With Bunching ($45,000 Every 3 Years)
| Year | Charitable Gift | Standard Deduction | Itemized Deductions | Benefit |
|------|----------------:|-------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|
| 2024 | $45,000 | $29,200 | $55,000 | Itemize ($25,800 over) |
| 2025 | $0 | $29,200 | $10,000 | Standard used |
| 2026 | $0 | $29,200 | $10,000 | Standard used |
| **Total** | **$45,000** | | | **$25,800 additional deduction** |

**Tax Savings at 32%**: $8,256

## Bunching Client Fit Criteria

### Ideal Candidates
- Taxpayers near standard deduction threshold
- Consistent charitable givers
- Those with flexibility in timing
- Taxpayers with other itemized deductions

### Bunching Triggers
- Large income year
- Business sale
- Stock vesting event
- Retirement distribution
- Any year with high marginal rate

## Bunching Implementation

### Step 1: Calculate Threshold
- Determine standard deduction amount
- Add non-charitable itemized deductions
- Calculate "bunching benefit zone"

### Step 2: Execute Bunch
**Options**:
1. **DAF Funding**: Contribute multiple years to DAF
2. **Direct Gifts**: Accelerate gifts to charities
3. **QCD for 70½+**: Use Qualified Charitable Distributions

### Step 3: Maintain Giving
- Grant from DAF in non-bunch years
- Or skip giving in non-bunch years
- Charities receive consistent support

## Bunching + DAF Combination

**Best Practice Strategy**:

1. Year 1: Large contribution to DAF (bunch)
2. Years 2-3: Grant from DAF to charities
3. Year 4: Large contribution to DAF (bunch)
4. Years 5-6: Grant from DAF to charities

**Benefits**:
- Maximizes deduction value
- Consistent charity support
- Simplified tracking
- Investment growth in DAF

# Combined Strategy Comparison

| Strategy | Best For | Complexity | Minimum Assets |
|----------|----------|------------|----------------|
| CRT | Large appreciated assets, income needs | High | $500,000+ |
| DAF | Flexible giving, bunching | Low | $5,000+ |
| Bunching | Standard deduction filers | Low | Any amount |

## Risks & Considerations

### CRT Risks
- Irrevocable commitment
- Charity receives remainder
- Income timing inflexibility
- Complex administration

### DAF Risks
- Irrevocable contribution
- Advisory privileges only
- No personal benefit allowed
- Some charities not eligible

### Bunching Risks
- Charity cash flow disruption
- Requires planning discipline
- Tax law changes could affect strategy
- Must track multi-year strategy

## Key Tax Code References

- **IRC Section 170**: Charitable contribution deduction
- **IRC Section 664**: Charitable Remainder Trusts
- **IRC Section 408(d)(8)**: Qualified Charitable Distributions

## Effective Dates

| Strategy | Provision | Effective Date | Status |
|----------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| CRTs | IRC Section 664 | Long-standing | Permanent - Active for 2026 |
| DAFs | IRC Section 4966 | Enacted 2006 (Pension Protection Act) | Permanent - Active for 2026 |
| Standard Deduction (MFJ) | TCJA | 2018-2025 (currently $29,200 for 2024) | Scheduled to decrease after 2025 |
| Charitable Bunching | N/A | Strategy-based, not statutory | Active for 2026 |

**2026 Tax Year Considerations**:
- The increased standard deduction under TCJA is scheduled to expire after 2025. If not extended, the standard deduction will decrease significantly in 2026, potentially making itemizing (including charitable deductions) more beneficial for many taxpayers.
- Charitable bunching strategy may be less necessary if standard deduction reverts to pre-TCJA levels.
- Monitor legislative developments regarding TCJA extension.
