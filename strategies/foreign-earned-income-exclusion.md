# Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE)

## Overview

The Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE) allows qualifying U.S. citizens and resident aliens living and working abroad to exclude up to $126,500 (2024) of foreign earned income from U.S. federal income tax. Combined with the Foreign Housing Exclusion, this provision significantly reduces or eliminates U.S. tax obligations for Americans working overseas.

## Key Benefits

- Exclude up to $126,500 of foreign earned income (2024)
- Additional housing exclusion available
- Reduces or eliminates U.S. tax on foreign earnings
- Available annually while qualifications met
- Can combine with Foreign Tax Credit (within limits)
- Significant savings for expatriates

## 2024 Exclusion Amounts

| Exclusion Type | Amount |
|----------------|--------|
| Foreign Earned Income | $126,500 |
| Housing Exclusion Base | $20,240 (16% of FEIE) |
| Housing Exclusion Maximum* | Varies by location |
| Housing Deduction | Same limits as exclusion |

*Location-specific limits published by IRS annually

## Requirements (Must Meet One Test)

### Test 1: Bona Fide Residence Test

**Requirements:**

## Housing Exclusion and Deduction

### Housing Exclusion (Employees)

**Excludable Amount:**
```
Housing Exclusion = Qualified Housing Expenses - Base Amount
Base Amount = 16% of FEIE maximum ($20,240 for 2024)
```

**Qualified Housing Expenses:**
- Rent
- Utilities (except telephone)
- Property insurance
- Occupancy taxes
- Security deposits (nonrefundable)
- Furniture rental
- Parking (residential)

**NOT Qualified:**
- Home purchase/mortgage principal
- Domestic help
- Home improvements
- Furniture purchase
- Television/streaming costs

### Location-Specific Limits

**High-Cost Cities (2024 Examples):**
| Location | Daily Limit | Annual Limit |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Hong Kong | $305 | $111,325 |
| Singapore | $199 | $72,635 |
| London | $220 | $80,300 |
| Tokyo | $230 | $83,950 |
| Base amount | | ($20,240) |

### Housing Deduction (Self-Employed)

**Same calculation as exclusion, but:**
- Claimed as deduction, not exclusion
- Limited to net self-employment income
- Carryforward available if limited

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Determine Eligibility

**Checklist:**
- [ ] U.S. citizen or resident alien
- [ ] Tax home in foreign country
- [ ] Meet bona fide residence OR physical presence test
- [ ] Have foreign earned income

### Step 2: Calculate Days (Physical Presence)

**Track carefully:**
- Start and end dates of qualifying period
- Each day in foreign country
- Travel days and locations
- U.S. days (disqualifying)

### Step 3: Calculate Exclusion

**Pro-Rata for Partial Years:**
```
Exclusion = $126,500 × (Days in Qualifying Period / 365)
```

### Step 4: File Required Forms

**Form 2555:** Foreign Earned Income
- Part I: General information
- Part II: Taxpayers qualifying under bona fide residence
- Part III: Taxpayers qualifying under physical presence
- Part IV: All taxpayers (calculate exclusion)
- Part VI: Housing (if applicable)

**Include with Form 1040**

### Step 5: Revocation Considerations

**If revoking election:**
- Can't re-elect for 5 years without IRS approval
- Revocation is binding
- Compare FEIE vs. FTC before revoking

## FEIE vs. Foreign Tax Credit

### When FEIE is Better

| Scenario | Why FEIE |
|----------|----------|
| Low/no foreign taxes | FTC provides no benefit |
| High U.S. tax bracket | Exclusion reduces bracket |
| Simplicity preferred | No basket calculations |
| Foreign tax higher than U.S. | May still prefer exclusion |

### When FTC is Better

| Scenario | Why FTC |
|----------|---------|
| High foreign taxes | Dollar-for-dollar credit |
| Income exceeds FEIE limit | FTC covers excess |
| Want retirement contribution basis | FEIE reduces SE income |
| Building FTC carryforward | Future use |

### Using Both (Stacking)

**Can use both, but no double benefit:**
- FEIE excludes income from U.S. tax
- Excluded income can't generate FTC
- Foreign tax on excluded income = not creditable
- Apportion if both apply

**Example:**
- Foreign income: $200,000
- Foreign tax: $50,000
- FEIE: $126,500 excluded
- Remaining income: $73,500
- FTC limitation based on $73,500
- Creditable foreign tax: $50,000 × ($73,500/$200,000) = $18,375

## Special Considerations

### Self-Employment Tax

**FEIE does NOT exclude from SE tax:**
- Still owe SE tax on self-employment income
- May be able to use Totalization Agreement
- Check with Social Security Administration

### Impact on Other Benefits

**Excluded income affects:**
| Item | Impact |
|------|--------|
| IRA contributions | May limit if only excluded income |
| Child Tax Credit | Based on earned income (including excluded) |
| Retirement plan contributions | Based on compensation |
| Social Security benefits | Reduced if lower SE tax |

### Married Couples

**Both must qualify separately:**
- Each spouse can claim own FEIE
- Combined potential: $253,000 (2024)
- Each needs qualifying test met
- File jointly or separately (MFS loses many benefits)

## Risks & Considerations

### Audit Risk Factors

| Factor | Risk Level |
|--------|------------|
| First-year claim | Higher |
| Large exclusion | Higher |
| Physical presence borderline | Higher |
| Self-employment income | Higher |
| Missing documentation | High |

### Common Mistakes

| Error | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| Incorrect day counting | Disqualification |
| Including unearned income | Adjustment |
| Not prorating partial year | Over-exclusion |
| Missing Form 2555 | Exclusion denied |
| Revoking without analysis | Lost opportunity |

## Case Study

### Scenario
David, a U.S. citizen software engineer, takes a job in Singapore:
- Start date: March 1, 2024
- Singapore salary: S$300,000 (~$222,000 USD)
- Singapore tax: ~$40,000
- Housing: $4,500/month employer-provided
- No U.S. visits planned for 2024

### Qualification Analysis

**Physical Presence Test (2024):**
- March 1 - December 31 = 306 days
- Need 330 days in any 12-month period
- March 1, 2024 - February 28, 2025 = 365 days
- If stays in Singapore, will have 330+ days
- **Qualifies for 2024** (using 12-month period straddling years)

**Bona Fide Residence:**
- First year partial, won't qualify until 2025

### 2024 Exclusion Calculation

**Pro-rata FEIE:**
- Days in qualifying period (Mar 1 - Dec 31): 306
- FEIE: $126,500 × (306/365) = $106,055

**Housing Exclusion:**
- Employer housing: $4,500 × 10 months = $45,000
- Singapore housing limit: ~$72,635
- Base amount: $20,240 × (306/365) = $16,970
- Housing exclusion: $45,000 - $16,970 = $28,030

**Total Exclusion:**
- FEIE: $106,055
- Housing: $28,030
- Total: $134,085

**Taxable in U.S.:**
- Total income: $222,000
- Less exclusions: ($134,085)
- Taxable: $87,915

**Foreign Tax Credit:**
- Only on non-excluded portion
- Apportioned: $40,000 × ($87,915/$222,000) = $15,838

### Tax Comparison

| Approach | U.S. Tax |
|----------|----------|
| No FEIE (FTC only) | ~$25,000 (after FTC) |
| With FEIE + FTC | ~$6,000 |
| **Savings** | **~$19,000** |
