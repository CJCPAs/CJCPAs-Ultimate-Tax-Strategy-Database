# Oil & Gas Tax Incentives

## Overview

The oil and gas industry enjoys unique tax incentives designed to encourage domestic energy production. These include intangible drilling costs (IDC) deductions, depletion allowances, and various credits. For investors and operators, these incentives can provide significant tax benefits, often allowing deductions that exceed the cash investment in the first year.

## Effective Dates & Key Law Changes

| Provision | Current Law | 2026 and Beyond |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| IDC Deduction | 100% current deduction (individuals) | Same |
| Percentage Depletion | Available for independents | Same |
| Passive Loss Rules | Generally passive | Same |
| At-Risk Rules | Apply | Same |
| Alternative Minimum Tax | IDC preference item | Same |
| Section 199A | May qualify | Expires (unless extended) |

**Note:** Oil & gas incentives are longstanding and not affected by TCJA sunset. However, political pressure for changes exists.

## Key Tax Benefits

### Overview of Major Deductions

| Benefit | Description | Who Qualifies |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Intangible Drilling Costs (IDC)** | Deduct 100% of non-salvageable costs | Operators, working interest |
| **Tangible Equipment** | Depreciation/Section 179 | Operators, working interest |
| **Percentage Depletion** | 15% of gross income | Independent producers |
| **Cost Depletion** | Return of basis | All producers |
| **Geological & Geophysical (G&G)** | Amortization over 24 months | All |
| **Passive Loss Exception** | Working interest not passive | General partners |

### Tax Impact Example

**$100,000 Investment in Oil Well:**

| Cost Category | Amount | Deduction Timing |
|---------------|--------|------------------|
| Intangible Drilling Costs | $65,000 | 100% Year 1 |
| Tangible Equipment | $20,000 | Depreciation |
| Lease Costs | $15,000 | Depletion over life |
| **Year 1 Deduction** | | **~$70,000-$80,000** |

**At 37% bracket:** $28,000+ tax savings on $100,000 investment

## Intangible Drilling Costs (IDC)

### What Qualifies as IDC

**Deductible as IDC:**
- Labor costs for drilling
- Fuel for drilling
- Supplies consumed in drilling
- Site preparation
- Well completion costs
- Repairs to drilling equipment
- Mud, chemicals, cement
- Core analysis, well logging

**NOT IDC (Tangible):**
- Wellhead equipment
- Casing (salvageable)
- Pumps
- Storage tanks
- Separators

### IDC Election Options

| Option | Treatment | When to Use |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Expense 100%** | Deduct entirely in Year 1 | Maximum current deduction |
| **Capitalize** | Add to basis, deplete | Avoid AMT preference |
| **60-Month Amortization** | Spread over 60 months | AMT planning |

### AMT Considerations

**IDC as Preference Item:**
- Excess IDC over 10-year amortization is AMT preference
- May trigger AMT
- Corporate AMT eliminated (but watch for restoration)
- Individual AMT still applies

**Planning:**
- Calculate AMT impact before electing
- Consider 60-month amortization if AMT issue
- Integrated companies must capitalize

## Depletion

### Percentage Depletion

**Available to Independent Producers:**
- 15% of gross income from property
- Cannot exceed 100% of net income from property
- 65% of taxable income limitation
- Can exceed cost basis (major advantage)

**Limitations:**
- Not available to major integrated companies
- 1,000 barrels/day or 6 MCF gas limitation
- Related party rules

### Cost Depletion

**For All Producers:**
- Recover cost basis over producing life
- Formula: (Units sold / Total estimated units) × Basis
- Cannot exceed basis
- Use greater of cost or percentage

### Depletion Example

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Gross Income | $500,000 |
| Lease Operating Expense | ($200,000) |
| Net Income | $300,000 |
| Percentage Depletion (15%) | $75,000 |
| 100% Net Income Cap | $300,000 |
| **Allowed Depletion** | **$75,000** |

## Working Interest Exception

### Passive Activity Rules

**General Rule:** Rental activities are passive

**Working Interest Exception:**
- Working interest in oil/gas is NOT passive
- If held directly (not LP)
- Can deduct against any income
- Huge planning opportunity

**Requirements:**
- General partner or direct ownership
- Not limited partner
- Not S-Corp shareholder
- Unlimited liability required

### Structure Comparison

| Structure | Passive? | Loss Treatment |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| General Partner | No | Active losses |
| Working Interest (direct) | No | Active losses |
| Limited Partner | Yes | Passive losses |
| LLC Member (manager) | No | Active losses |
| S-Corp Shareholder | Yes | Passive losses |

## Client Fit Criteria

### Ideal Candidates

| Characteristic | Why Favorable |
|----------------|---------------|
| High ordinary income | Maximum deduction benefit |
| 37% tax bracket | Full IDC benefit |
| Risk tolerant | Oil/gas is speculative |
| Long-term investment horizon | Multi-year returns |
| Understanding of industry | Complex investments |
| Not in AMT | IDC not AMT preference |

### Investment Amounts

| Income Level | Suggested Maximum | Rationale |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Under $500K | Minimal | Risk too high |
| $500K-$1M | Up to $50,000 | Moderate allocation |
| $1M-$5M | Up to $200,000 | Diversification |
| Over $5M | Up to $500,000 | Significant allocation |

### Who Should Avoid

| Situation | Concern |
|-----------|---------|
| AMT taxpayer | IDC preference |
| Need liquidity | Illiquid investment |
| Low risk tolerance | Speculative |
| Limited partner preference | Lose working interest exception |
| Short time horizon | Multi-year development |

## Case Study

### Scenario

Dr. Williams, surgeon earning $800,000/year:
- 37% federal bracket
- No AMT issues
- Risk tolerant, long-term investor
- Seeking tax deferral

### Investment Analysis

**Investment:** $150,000 in drilling program

**Cost Structure:**
| Category | Percentage | Amount |
|----------|------------|--------|
| IDC | 70% | $105,000 |
| Tangible Equipment | 15% | $22,500 |
| Lease/Land Costs | 15% | $22,500 |
| **Total** | **100%** | **$150,000** |

### Year 1 Tax Benefit

| Deduction | Amount | Tax Savings (37%) |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| IDC (100%) | $105,000 | $38,850 |
| Tangible (MACRS Year 1) | $10,000 | $3,700 |
| **Year 1 Total** | **$115,000** | **$42,550** |

**Effective Investment:** $150,000 - $42,550 = **$107,450** after-tax

### Ongoing Production (Hypothetical)

| Year | Revenue | Operating Expenses | Depletion | Net Income |
|------|---------|-------------------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | $20,000 | ($8,000) | ($3,000) | $9,000 |
| 2 | $25,000 | ($10,000) | ($3,750) | $11,250 |
| 3 | $22,000 | ($9,000) | ($3,300) | $9,700 |
| 4 | $18,000 | ($8,000) | ($2,700) | $7,300 |
| 5 | $15,000 | ($7,000) | ($2,250) | $5,750 |

**Total Return Analysis:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Initial investment | ($150,000) |
| Year 1 tax savings | $42,550 |
| Net revenue (Years 1-5) | $43,000 |
| Tax on revenue (37%) | ($15,910) |
