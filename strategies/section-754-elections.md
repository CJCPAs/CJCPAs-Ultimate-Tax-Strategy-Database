# Section 754 Elections (Partnership Basis Adjustments)

## Overview

A Section 754 election allows a partnership to adjust the basis of partnership property when a partner sells or exchanges their partnership interest, or when a partner dies and the interest passes to an heir. Without this election, significant tax inefficiencies can occur—new partners may pay tax on gains that economically accrued before they acquired their interest. Understanding Section 754 is critical for partnerships, LLCs taxed as partnerships, and their advisors.

## Effective Dates & Key Law Changes

| Provision | Current Law | 2026 and Beyond |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Section 754 Election | Available | No change expected |
| Section 743(b) Adjustment | Transfer of interest | No change expected |
| Section 734(b) Adjustment | Distribution of property | No change expected |
| Mandatory Adjustment | $250K+ built-in loss | No change expected |
| Estate Step-Up (1014) | Available | Available (no change scheduled) |
| Capital Gains Rate | 0%/15%/20% + 3.8% | Same expected |

**Note:** Section 754 rules are established provisions not affected by TCJA sunset. However, proposals to limit stepped-up basis could impact planning significantly.

### Two Types of Basis Adjustments

| Section | Trigger | Adjustment |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **743(b)** | Sale/exchange of partnership interest OR death of partner | Adjusts new partner's share of inside basis |
| **734(b)** | Distribution of property to partner | Adjusts partnership's basis in remaining property |

## How Section 754 Works

### Section 743(b) Adjustment (Transfer of Interest)

**Calculation:**
```
743(b) Adjustment = Transferee's Outside Basis - Share of Inside Basis
```

**Example:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Purchase price for 50% interest | $250,000 |
| Share of partnership's inside basis | $50,000 |
| **Section 743(b) adjustment** | **+$200,000** |

**Result:** Partner B gets $200,000 basis adjustment allocated among partnership assets

### Section 734(b) Adjustment (Distribution)

**Triggers:**
1. Distribution of money exceeding partner's basis
2. Distribution of property with basis different from FMV

**Example:**
| Scenario | Adjustment |
|----------|------------|
| Partner receives $100,000 cash, basis was $80,000 | Partnership gets -$20,000 adjustment |
| Partner receives property with $60,000 basis, takes $40,000 basis | Partnership gets +$20,000 adjustment |

### Allocation of 743(b) Adjustment

**Two Classes of Property:**

| Class | Assets | Allocation Method |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| **Capital/1231** | Real estate, equipment, goodwill | Proportionate to gain/loss |
| **Ordinary** | Inventory, unrealized receivables | Proportionate to gain/loss |

**Within each class:** Allocate adjustment proportionally based on built-in gain/loss

## Requirements

### Making the Election

**How to Elect:**
- Written statement attached to partnership return
- For tax year of transfer/distribution (or subsequent year if late)
- Signed by partner or authorized representative
- States partnership elects under Section 754

**Required Statement Contents:**
1. Name and address of partnership
2. Statement that partnership elects under Section 754
3. Signature of partner authorized to sign

### Once Made, Election is Binding

**Critical Point:**
- Election applies to ALL future transfers and distributions
- Cannot be revoked without IRS consent
- Applies to positive AND negative adjustments
- Consider carefully before electing

### Mandatory Adjustments (Section 743(d))

**No Election Needed If:**
- Partnership has "substantial built-in loss" (>$250,000)
- Section 743(b) adjustment is mandatory
- Prevents loss trafficking

### Required Reporting

| Form | Information |
|------|-------------|
| Schedule K-1 | Report partner's share of basis adjustment |
| Form 1065 | Report election and adjustments |
| Partner records | Track adjustments annually |

## Client Fit Criteria

### When Section 754 is Beneficial

| Situation | Benefit |
|-----------|---------|
| Partner death (stepped-up basis) | Heir gets inside basis step-up |
| Partner buyout at premium | Buyer avoids phantom gain |
| Appreciated partnership assets | New partner's share stepped up |
| Real estate partnerships | Depreciation on stepped-up basis |
| Investment partnerships | Avoid double taxation |

### When Section 754 May Be Problematic

| Situation | Concern |
|-----------|---------|
| Depreciated assets | New partner's basis stepped DOWN |
| Frequent partner changes | Administrative burden |
| Complex asset mix | Allocation calculations difficult |
| Partnership losses | May reduce future deductions |

### Decision Framework

| Factor | Consider 754 | Avoid 754 |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Assets appreciated | ✓ | |
| Assets depreciated | | ✓ |
| Few partner changes | ✓ | |
| Many partner changes | | ✓ (admin burden) |
| Estate planning focus | ✓ | |
| Partnership has losses | | ✓ |

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Analysis

1. **Evaluate Partnership Assets**
   - Current FMV of all assets
   - Tax basis of all assets
   - Built-in gain or loss by asset

2. **Consider Future Transfers**
   - Likelihood of partner changes
   - Estate planning considerations
   - Buy-sell agreement provisions

3. **Model Scenarios**
   - With and without election
   - Impact on different partners
   - Administrative costs

### Phase 2: Making the Election

1. **Draft Election Statement**
   ```
   Section 754 Election Statement

   [Partnership Name]
   [EIN]
   [Address]

   The above-named partnership hereby elects under
   Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code to adjust
   the basis of partnership property as provided in
   Sections 734(b) and 743(b).

   This election is effective for the taxable year
   ending [date] and all subsequent taxable years.

   ___________________________
   [Signature of authorized partner]
   [Date]
   ```

2. **Attach to Tax Return**
   - File with Form 1065
   - For year of first qualifying event
   - Or any subsequent year

3. **Document Calculations**
   - Basis adjustment computation
   - Asset allocation
   - Supporting workpapers

### Phase 3: Ongoing Administration

1. **Track Each Transfer**
   - Calculate 743(b) adjustment
   - Allocate to assets
   - Maintain adjustment schedules

2. **Annual Reporting**
   - K-1 disclosure to affected partners
   - Partnership records
   - Depreciation adjustments

3. **Monitor for Distributions**
   - Calculate 734(b) adjustments
   - Update basis schedules

## Tax Calculations

### Complete Section 743(b) Example

**Partnership ABC:**
- 3 equal partners (A, B, C)
- Each partner's outside basis: $100,000
- Total inside basis: $300,000

**Partnership Assets:**
| Asset | Basis | FMV | Built-in Gain |
|-------|-------|-----|---------------|
| Building | $150,000 | $300,000 | $150,000 |
| Equipment | $100,000 | $120,000 | $20,000 |
| Inventory | $50,000 | $80,000 | $30,000 |
| **Total** | **$300,000** | **$500,000** | **$200,000** |

**Partner A sells to Partner D for $166,667 (1/3 of FMV)**

**Section 743(b) Calculation:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| D's purchase price (outside basis) | $166,667 |
| D's share of inside basis (1/3) | $100,000 |
| **Section 743(b) adjustment** | **$66,667** |

**Allocation of $66,667 Adjustment:**

**Capital Assets (Building + Equipment):**
| Asset | D's Share of Gain | Adjustment |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| Building | $50,000 ($150K × 1/3) | $50,000 |
| Equipment | $6,667 ($20K × 1/3) | $6,667 |
| **Subtotal** | **$56,667** | **$56,667** |

**Ordinary Assets (Inventory):**
| Asset | D's Share of Gain | Adjustment |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| Inventory | $10,000 ($30K × 1/3) | $10,000 |

**Total Adjustment:** $56,667 + $10,000 = $66,667 ✓

**Result for Partner D:**
- Building basis: $50,000 (1/3 of $150K) + $50,000 adj = $100,000
- Equipment basis: $33,333 (1/3 of $100K) + $6,667 adj = $40,000
- Inventory basis: $16,667 (1/3 of $50K) + $10,000 adj = $26,667

### Death of Partner Example

**Partner B dies, heir inherits interest:**
- FMV of interest at death: $166,667
- Heir's outside basis: $166,667 (stepped up under 1014)
- Share of inside basis: $100,000
- **Section 743(b) adjustment: $66,667**

**Key Point:** Without 754 election, heir would inherit outside basis of $166,667 but only $100,000 inside basis—creating $66,667 of phantom gain!

### Depreciation Impact

**Additional Depreciation from 743(b):**
| Asset | Adjustment | Life | Annual Depreciation |
|-------|------------|------|---------------------|
| Building | $50,000 | 39 years | $1,282 |
| Equipment | $6,667 | 5 years | $1,333 |

**Tax Savings (37% rate):** ~$967/year additional depreciation

## Special Situations

### Tiered Partnerships

**When partnership owns partnership interests:**
- 754 election at each level
- Push-down of adjustments
- Complex calculations
- Coordinate elections

### Substantial Built-in Loss

**Mandatory Adjustment (No Election Needed):**
- If transferee would have >$250,000 loss
- Based on hypothetical sale of all assets
- Applies to transfers after 10/22/2004
- Cannot avoid with no election

### Hot Assets (Section 751)

**Ordinary Income Property:**
- Unrealized receivables
- Inventory items
- Separate calculation required
- Look-through rules apply

### Negative Adjustments

**When Basis is Stepped DOWN:**
- Partner paid less than share of inside basis
- 743(b) adjustment is negative
- Reduces depreciation, increases gain
- Can be problematic for buying partner

## Case Study

### Scenario

Real Estate Partnership:
- 4 equal partners (25% each)
- Owns apartment building
- Original cost: $4,000,000
- Current FMV: $8,000,000
- Accumulated depreciation: $1,500,000
- Current basis: $2,500,000

**Partner A dies, interest passes to son (Heir):**

### Without Section 754 Election

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Heir's outside basis (stepped up) | $2,000,000 |
| Heir's share of inside basis (25%) | $625,000 |
| **Basis mismatch** | **$1,375,000** |

**If partnership sells building for $8,000,000:**
| Item | Heir's Share (25%) |
|------|-------------------|
| Sale proceeds | $2,000,000 |
| Share of basis | $625,000 |
| Taxable gain | **$1,375,000** |

**Tax on "phantom" gain:** $1,375,000 × 23.8% = **$327,250**

### With Section 754 Election

**Section 743(b) Calculation:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Heir's outside basis | $2,000,000 |
| Heir's share of inside basis | $625,000 |
| **743(b) adjustment** | **$1,375,000** |

**Heir's Effective Basis in Building:**
- Share of partnership basis: $625,000
- Plus 743(b) adjustment: $1,375,000
- **Effective basis: $2,000,000**

**If partnership sells for $8,000,000:**
| Item | Heir's Share |
|------|-------------|
| Sale proceeds | $2,000,000 |
| Effective basis | $2,000,000 |
| **Taxable gain** | **$0** |

**Tax Savings: $327,250**

### Additional Depreciation Benefit

**743(b) Adjustment Depreciation:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Adjustment to building | $1,375,000 |
| Remaining life | 30 years |
| Annual depreciation | $45,833 |
| Tax savings (37%) | $16,958/year |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Not making election | Phantom gain for new partners | Evaluate at each transfer |
| Making election with depreciated assets | Basis reduction | Analyze before electing |
| Incorrect allocation | IRS adjustment | Follow regulations carefully |
| Missing mandatory adjustment | Penalties | Check >$250K loss threshold |
| Not tracking adjustments | Compliance issues | Maintain schedules |
| Forgetting distributions | Miss 734(b) adjustments | Track all distributions |
