# Energy Tax Credits (IRA 2022)

## Overview

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) dramatically expanded and extended energy tax credits, creating unprecedented opportunities for businesses and individuals to reduce tax liability through clean energy investments. These credits are now available through at least 2032, with many provisions potentially lasting until 2050 based on emission reduction targets.

## Effective Dates & Key Law Changes

| Credit | Pre-IRA | Post-IRA (2023+) | Duration |
|--------|---------|-----------------|----------|
| Solar ITC | 26% (declining) | 30% base | Through 2032+ |
| Wind PTC | Expiring | $0.0275/kWh (2024) | Through 2032+ |
| Residential Clean Energy | 26% | 30% | Through 2032 |
| Clean Vehicle | $7,500 max | $7,500 (new rules) | Through 2032 |
| Energy Efficient Home | $2,000 max | $3,200 max | Permanent |
| Commercial EV | 10% | 30% | Through 2032 |
| Section 45X Manufacturing | None | New credit | Through 2032 |

**2026 Note:** Unlike TCJA provisions, IRA energy credits are NOT sunsetting. They remain through 2032 (or longer based on emission targets).

- Buyer uses credit against their liability
- Typically 85-95 cents per dollar

**Process:**
1. Complete project

5. Buyer claims on return

## Client Fit Criteria

### Business ITC/PTC Candidates

| Characteristic | Why Favorable |
|----------------|---------------|
| Sufficient tax liability | Credit is non-refundable |
| Long-term ownership plans | Credit recapture rules |
| Energy costs significant | ROI from savings |
| Suitable property | Roof, land, etc. |
| Cash/financing available | Upfront investment |

### Residential Credit Candidates

| Characteristic | Benefit |

| Owns home | Required for credit |
| Federal tax liability | Credit is non-refundable |
| Plans to stay in home | Maximize benefit |
| High energy costs | Additional ROI |
| Sufficient income | Finance investment |

## Planning Strategies

### Strategy 1: Stack Multiple Credits

**Example Commercial Building:**
| Credit | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Solar ITC (30%) | $300,000 |
| Energy Community bonus (+10%) | $100,000 |
| Domestic content bonus (+10%) | $100,000 |
| **Total Credit** | **$500,000** |

On $1,000,000 solar installation = **50% credit**

### Strategy 2: Pair with Depreciation

**Solar Example:**
| Benefit | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Cost | $1,000,000 |
| ITC (30%) | ($300,000) credit |
| Basis for depreciation | $850,000* |
| Bonus depreciation (60% in 2024) | $510,000 deduction |

*Basis reduced by 50% of ITC

**Combined Year 1 Benefit:**
- $300,000 credit
- $510,000 × 37% = $188,700 tax savings
- **Total: ~$488,700 benefit**

### Strategy 3: Credit Transfer

**If insufficient tax liability:**
1. Complete qualifying project
2. Register transfer with IRS
3. Sell credit to third party
4. Receive 85-95% of credit value in cash

**Example:**
- $100,000 credit earned
- Sell at 90 cents
- Receive $90,000 cash

### Strategy 4: Time Projects for Maximum Bonus

**Bonus Depreciation Schedule:**
| Year | Bonus Depreciation |
|------|-------------------|
| 2024 | 60% |
| 2025 | 40% |
| 2026 | 20% |
| 2027+ | 0% |

**Strategy:** Complete energy projects in 2024-2025 for best combined benefit

### Strategy 5: Residential Credit Stacking

**Annual Strategy:**
- 2024: Heat pump + battery ($5,000+ credit)
- 2025: Windows + insulation ($1,800 credit)
- 2026: Solar installation ($7,500+ credit)
- Each year maximizes annual limits

## Case Study

### Scenario: Commercial Solar Installation

**ABC Manufacturing:**
- Installing 500 kW solar array
- Cost: $1,250,000
- Energy community location
- Will meet PWA requirements
- 35% marginal tax rate

### Credit Calculation

| Component | Rate | Amount |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Base ITC | 30% | $375,000 |
| Energy Community Bonus | 10% | $125,000 |
| **Total Credit** | **40%** | **$500,000** |

### Depreciation Benefit

| Item | Calculation | Amount |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Cost | | $1,250,000 |
| Less: 50% of ITC | $500,000 × 50% | ($250,000) |
| Depreciable Basis | | $1,000,000 |
| Bonus Depreciation (60%) | $1,000,000 × 60% | $600,000 |
| Year 1 Tax Savings | $600,000 × 35% | $210,000 |

### Total Year 1 Benefit

| Benefit | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| ITC | $500,000 |
| Depreciation tax savings | $210,000 |
| **Total Year 1** | **$710,000** |

**Effective Cost:** $1,250,000 - $710,000 = **$540,000** (57% reduction)

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Missing PWA requirements | 6% vs. 30% credit | Plan from start |
| Not meeting domestic content | Miss bonus | Verify supply chain |
| Insufficient tax liability | Unused credit | Consider transfer |
| Missing registration | Cannot transfer | Register timely |
| Recapture on sale | Credit clawback | Plan holding period |
| Wrong vehicle requirements | No credit | Verify before purchase |
