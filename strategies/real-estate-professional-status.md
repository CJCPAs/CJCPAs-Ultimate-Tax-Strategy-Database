# Real Estate Professional Status (REPS)

## Overview

Real Estate Professional Status (REPS) is a tax classification that allows taxpayers to treat rental real estate losses as non-passive, enabling them to offset those losses against ordinary income (W-2, business income, etc.). Without REPS, rental losses are typically passive and can only offset passive income.

## Key Benefits

- Convert passive rental losses to non-passive
- Offset W-2 and business income with real estate depreciation
- Significant tax reduction when combined with cost segregation
- Potentially reduce taxable income to near zero
- Maximize value of accelerated depreciation strategies

## The Passive Activity Loss Problem

### Without REPS
```
Rental real estate income/loss → Passive Activity
Can only offset: Other passive income
Cannot offset: W-2 wages, business income, investment income
Unused losses: Suspended until passive income or property sale
```

### With REPS
```
Rental real estate income/loss → Non-Passive Activity
Can offset: ALL income types (W-2, business, investment)
Result: Significant tax reduction possible
```

## Requirements

### Two-Part Test (MUST MEET BOTH)

**Part 1: More Than Half Test**
More than 50% of personal services performed during the year must be in real property trades or businesses in which the taxpayer materially participates.

**Part 2: 750-Hour Test**
Must perform more than 750 hours of services during the year in real property trades or businesses in which the taxpayer materially participates.

### Material Participation (Per Property)
Must ALSO materially participate in each rental activity. Most common tests:
- More than 500 hours of participation
- Substantially all participation
- More than 100 hours and no other person participates more

### What Counts as Real Property Trades or Businesses
- Real property development
- Redevelopment
- Construction
- Reconstruction
- Acquisition
- Conversion
- Rental
- Operation
- Management
- Leasing
- Brokerage

## Aggregation Election

### Default Rule
Each rental property is a separate activity for material participation.

### Election to Aggregate
- File statement with tax return
- All rentals treated as single activity
- Easier to meet 500+ hour material participation test
- Cannot be revoked without IRS consent
- Must be made in first year of REPS status

## Client Fit Criteria

### Ideal Candidates
- Non-working spouse in high-income household
- Real estate agents/brokers
- Property managers
- Real estate developers
- Taxpayers able to leave other employment
- Multiple rental property owners

### Typical Scenarios
- Physician spouse manages family rental portfolio
- Tech executive's spouse handles real estate investments
- Retired executive actively managing properties
- Licensed real estate professional with rental properties

### Poor Fit
- Full-time W-2 employees with no real estate profession
- Taxpayers with limited rental holdings
- Those unable to document sufficient hours
- Triple-net lease investors (minimal management)

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Evaluate Qualification

1. **Assess Current Work Hours**
   - Calculate hours in all occupations
   - Determine real estate vs. other employment
   - Evaluate spouse's availability

2. **Plan for 750+ Hours**
   - Identify qualifying real estate activities
   - Project hours needed
   - Consider acquiring more properties if needed

3. **Consider Trade-offs**
   - Reduced hours in other employment
   - Income impact of reduced employment
   - Long-term commitment required

### Step 2: Establish Time Tracking System

1. **Daily Time Log Requirements**
   - Date of activity
   - Time spent (start/end or duration)
   - Description of activity
   - Property address affected

2. **Acceptable Activities**
   - Property inspections
   - Tenant communications
   - Rent collection
   - Maintenance coordination
   - Research on properties
   - Traveling to properties
   - Bookkeeping for rentals
   - Meeting with professionals

3. **Excluded Activities**
   - Investor-type activities
   - General education (not property-specific)
   - Personal use of property

### Step 3: Documentation Best Practices

1. **Contemporaneous Records**
   - Log hours daily or weekly
   - Use apps, spreadsheets, or journals
   - Include specific details

2. **Supporting Documentation**
   - Calendar entries
   - Emails and texts
   - Receipts and invoices
   - Photos of work performed
   - Vendor communications

3. **Year-End Summary**
   - Total hours by property
   - Total hours by activity type
   - Comparison to prior years

### Step 4: Tax Filing

1. **Make Elections**
   - Aggregation election (if beneficial)
   - Attach required statements to return
   - Retain copy of elections

2. **Complete Forms**
   - Schedule E (rental income/loss)
   - Form 8582 (if needed)
   - Retain REPS documentation

## Qualifying Hours Examples

### Property Management Activities

| Activity | Typical Time | Frequency |
|----------|--------------|-----------|

| Maintenance coordination | 1-3 hours | As needed |
| Contractor supervision | 2-4 hours | Per project |
| Bookkeeping | 1-2 hours | Monthly |
| Property research | 2-4 hours | Ongoing |

| Inspections (5 properties) | 8 | 96 |
| Tenant communications | 10 | 120 |
| Maintenance coordination | 15 | 180 |

## Risks & Considerations

### Audit Risk
- REPS is heavily audited
- IRS specifically targets this status
- Burden of proof on taxpayer
- Contemporaneous logs essential

### Common Audit Issues
- Insufficient documentation
- Inflated hour claims
- Full-time employment elsewhere
- Inconsistent records
- No aggregation election when needed

### Red Flags
- Full-time W-2 employee claiming REPS
- Sudden REPS status in year of large purchase
- Round number hours (e.g., exactly 750)
- No logs or records
- Similar hours every month

### Recapture Risk
- Depreciation recapture at 25% on sale
- Cost segregation magnifies recapture
- Plan exit strategy carefully
- 1031 exchange can defer recapture

## Case Study

### Scenario
Dr. Jones earns $800,000 as a surgeon. Spouse manages 8 rental properties with combined value of $4,000,000.

### Without REPS
- Rental income before depreciation: $200,000
- Standard depreciation: ($100,000)
- Net rental income: $100,000 (passive)
- Cost segregation unavailable (would create suspended loss)

**Total taxable income**: $900,000

### With REPS (Spouse Qualifies)

**Spouse's Activities:**
- Manages all 8 properties
- Handles tenant relations, maintenance, bookkeeping
- Documents 1,100 hours in real estate
- No other employment

**Cost Segregation Applied:**
- Cost segregation studies on all properties
- First-year bonus depreciation: $500,000
- Regular depreciation: $100,000
- Total depreciation: $600,000

**Tax Calculation:**
- Rental income before depreciation: $200,000
- Total depreciation: ($600,000)
- Net rental loss: ($400,000)
- Loss is non-passive (REPS + material participation)

**Tax Impact:**
- Dr. Jones W-2 income: $800,000
- Rental loss deduction: ($400,000)
- **Adjusted Gross Income: $400,000**
- **Tax savings (37% bracket): ~$148,000**

## Related Tax Planning

### Cost Segregation Synergy
- REPS unlocks full value of accelerated depreciation
- Without REPS, cost seg losses may be suspended
- Combine strategies for maximum benefit

### 199A Consideration
- Rental income qualifies for permanent 23% Section 199A deduction
- REPS rental income is QBI eligible
- Real estate safe harbor alternative
- 199A made permanent by OBBBA (July 2025) at 23% rate

### Net Investment Income Tax
- REPS can avoid 3.8% NIIT on rental income
- Must materially participate
- Significant additional savings for high earners

## Effective Dates

| Provision | Effective Date | Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Real Estate Professional Exception | Revenue Reconciliation Act 1993 | Permanent |
| 750-Hour Test | 1993 | Permanent |
| Material Participation Requirements | Section 469 Regulations | Permanent |
| Aggregation Election | 1993 | Permanent |

**2026 Tax Year**: REPS remains fully available for 2026. This strategy is especially valuable when combined with:
- Cost segregation (even at 20% bonus depreciation in 2026)
- Standard MACRS depreciation acceleration
- Permanent 23% Section 199A deduction on rental income
