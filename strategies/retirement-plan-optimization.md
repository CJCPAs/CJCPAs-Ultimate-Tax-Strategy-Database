## Contribution Optimization Strategies

### Mega Backdoor Roth
1. Make after-tax contributions to 401(k) beyond normal limits
2. Immediately convert to Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA
3. Allows additional $46,000+ in Roth contributions
4. Requires plan to allow after-tax contributions and in-service withdrawals

### DB/DC Combination
1. Establish defined benefit plan for base contributions
2. Add 401(k) for employee deferrals
3. Combine for $300,000+ annual deductions
4. Ideal for high earners age 50+

### Multiple Business Strategy
1. Separate businesses with different retirement plans
2. Controlled group rules must be evaluated
3. Potential for stacking contribution limits
4. Careful compliance required

## Case Study

### Scenario
Dr. Smith, age 55, owns a dental practice. Net income: $400,000. One hygienist employee earning $60,000.

### Traditional Approach (SEP IRA Only)
- Dr. Smith contribution: $69,000 (25% cap)
- Employee contribution required: $15,000 (same 25%)
- **Net tax savings at 37%: ~$25,530**

### Optimized Approach (Cash Balance + 401(k))
- Cash Balance contribution for Dr. Smith: $175,000
- 401(k) deferral: $30,500
- Employee cash balance: $12,000 (lower % tier)
- **Total deduction: $205,500**
- **Net tax savings at 37%: ~$76,035**

### Annual Additional Savings: ~$50,000
