# Vehicle Deductions

## Overview

Vehicle deductions allow businesses and self-employed individuals to deduct the costs of using vehicles for business purposes. Taxpayers can choose between the standard mileage rate method and the actual expense method, each with distinct advantages. Proper vehicle expense documentation and method selection can result in significant tax savings.

## Key Benefits

- Deduct costs of business vehicle use
- Standard mileage method offers simplicity
- Actual expense method may yield larger deductions
- Section 179 and bonus depreciation for purchased vehicles
- Heavy vehicles avoid luxury auto limits
- Documented business mileage creates audit protection

## Two Deduction Methods

### Standard Mileage Rate

**2024 Rates:**
| Purpose | Rate per Mile |
|---------|---------------|
| Business | $0.67 |
| Medical/Moving | $0.21 |
| Charitable | $0.14 |

**What's Included:**
- Gas and oil
- Repairs and maintenance
- Insurance
- Registration and license fees
- Depreciation (built into rate)

**What's NOT Included (Add Separately):**
- Parking fees (business)
- Tolls (business)
- Interest on auto loan (if itemizing actual expenses)
- Personal property taxes on vehicle

### Actual Expense Method

**Deductible Expenses:**
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Operating | Gas, oil, repairs, tires, washes |
| Ownership | Depreciation, lease payments |
| Fixed | Insurance, registration, licenses |
| Financing | Interest on auto loan |

**Calculation:**
```
Business Deduction = Total Expenses × Business Use Percentage
```

### Method Comparison

| Factor | Standard Mileage | Actual Expense |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| Simplicity | Easy | Complex |
| Record keeping | Mileage log | All receipts + log |
| Best for | High mileage, cheap car | Expensive car, low mileage |
| Depreciation | Automatic (in rate) | Calculate separately |
| Flexibility | Can switch (with rules) | Can switch to standard |
| First-year bonus | No | Yes (Section 179/bonus) |

## Business Use Percentage

### Calculating Business Use

**Business Miles:**
- Travel between work locations
- Client/customer visits
- Business errands
- Travel to temporary work locations (< 1 year)
- NOT: Commuting (home to regular office)

**Commuting Exception:**
| Situation | Deductible? |
|-----------|-------------|
| Home to office | No (commuting) |
| Home office to client | Yes (business) |
| Office to client | Yes (business) |
| Client to client | Yes (business) |
| Home to temporary work site | Yes (business) |
| Personal errands | No |

### Mileage Log Requirements

**Required Information:**
- Date of trip
- Destination (or trip description)
- Business purpose
- Miles driven
- Starting/ending odometer (recommended)

**Documentation Methods:**
- Paper log
- Spreadsheet
- Mobile apps (MileIQ, Everlance)
- GPS tracking systems

## Standard Mileage Rate Rules

### Requirements

**To use standard mileage:**
- Own or lease the vehicle
- Not operating five or more vehicles simultaneously (fleet)
- Not claiming Section 179 or bonus depreciation on vehicle
- Not claimed MACRS depreciation using method other than straight-line
- Not claimed actual expenses after 1997 (for same vehicle)

### When Standard Mileage Makes Sense

| Situation | Why Standard is Better |
|-----------|----------------------|
| High mileage (20,000+ business miles) | Rate × miles adds up |
| Fuel-efficient or inexpensive vehicle | Actual costs low |
| Don't want detailed records | Simpler tracking |
| Vehicle fully depreciated | No depreciation to claim anyway |
| Leased vehicle | Inclusion amount avoided |

## Actual Expense Method

### Depreciation Options

**Luxury Auto Limits (2024) - Passenger Vehicles:**

| Year | With Bonus | Without Bonus |
|------|------------|---------------|
| Year 1 | $20,400 | $12,400 |
| Year 2 | $19,800 | $19,800 |
| Year 3 | $11,900 | $11,900 |
| Year 4+ | $7,160 | $7,160 |

**Heavy Vehicles (>6,000 lbs GVWR) - No Luxury Limits:**

| Method | Deduction |
|--------|-----------|
| Section 179 (SUV) | Up to $30,500 |
| Section 179 (Truck/Van) | Up to $1,220,000 |
| Bonus depreciation | 60% (2024) |
| MACRS | 5-year recovery |

### When Actual Expense Makes Sense

| Situation | Why Actual is Better |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Expensive vehicle | Higher depreciation base |
| Low mileage | Standard rate yields little |
| Heavy SUV/Truck | Avoid luxury limits |
| New vehicle | Section 179 + Bonus available |
| High actual costs | Gas, repairs exceed rate |

### Actual Expense Calculation Example

**Vehicle: $60,000 SUV, 6,500 lb GVWR**
**Business use: 80%**
**Annual miles: 15,000 total, 12,000 business**

**Year 1 Actual Expenses:**
| Item | Total | Business (80%) |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Gas | $4,000 | $3,200 |
| Insurance | $2,000 | $1,600 |
| Repairs | $500 | $400 |
| Registration | $400 | $320 |
| Depreciation* | $30,500 | $24,400 |
| **Total** | | **$29,920** |

*Section 179 (SUV cap: $30,500)

**Compare to Standard Mileage:**
12,000 miles × $0.67 = $8,040

**Actual expense saves: $21,880**

## Heavy Vehicle Strategy

## Leased Vehicle Considerations

### Standard Mileage for Leased Vehicles

**Requirements:**
- Must choose standard mileage from start of lease
- Must use standard mileage for entire lease term
- Can switch to actual expense for subsequent vehicles

### Actual Expense for Leased Vehicles

**Deductible:**
- Lease payments × business %
- Plus: gas, insurance, repairs × business %

**Inclusion Amount:**
- Must reduce deduction by "inclusion amount"
- Prevents excessive deductions for luxury leases
- Amounts published annually by IRS
- Reduces lease deduction slightly

## Employer-Provided Vehicles

### Taxable Fringe Benefit

**If employer provides vehicle for personal use:**
- Personal use = taxable compensation
- Must track and report personal miles
- Several valuation methods available

### Valuation Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Annual Lease Value | IRS table based on FMV |
| Cents-per-mile | $0.67/personal mile (2024) |
| Commuting valuation | $1.50/one-way commute |

### Employer Best Practices
- Require mileage logs
- Establish written vehicle policy
- Reimburse employee-owned vehicle use instead
- Use accountable plan for reimbursements

## Switching Methods

### When Can You Switch?

| Situation | Can Switch To |
|-----------|---------------|
| First year with vehicle | Either method |
| Used standard, want actual | Yes (but no MACRS already used) |
| Used actual, want standard | Yes (but straight-line depreciation only going forward) |
| Used Section 179/Bonus | Cannot use standard mileage |

### Strategic Switching

**Year 1-3:** Use actual expense with Section 179/bonus
**Year 4+:** Switch to standard mileage (depreciation exhausted, standard may be higher)

## Case Study

### Scenario
Tom, a self-employed consultant, buys a new vehicle:
- Vehicle: Cadillac Escalade ($85,000)
- GVWR: 7,400 lbs (qualifies as heavy SUV)
- Business use: 90%
- Annual miles: 18,000 (16,200 business)

### Year 1 Comparison

**Standard Mileage:**
- 16,200 miles × $0.67 = $10,854

**Actual Expense:**
| Item | Total | Business (90%) |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Gas | $5,000 | $4,500 |
| Insurance | $2,400 | $2,160 |
| Registration | $500 | $450 |
| Section 179 | $30,500 | $27,450 |
| Bonus (60%)* | $32,700 | $29,430 |
| **Total** | | **$63,990** |

*$54,500 × 60% = $32,700

**Year 1 Advantage: Actual expense by $53,136**

### 5-Year Analysis

| Year | Standard Mileage | Actual Expense |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | $10,854 | $63,990 |
| 2 | $10,854 | $25,140 |
| 3 | $10,854 | $14,820 |
| 4 | $10,854 | $10,260 |
| 5 | $10,854 | $9,180 |
| **Total** | **$54,270** | **$123,390** |

**5-Year Advantage: $69,120**
