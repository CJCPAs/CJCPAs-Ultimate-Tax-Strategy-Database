# Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax (GSTT) Planning

## Overview

The Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax (GSTT or GST tax) is a federal tax imposed on transfers of property to beneficiaries who are two or more generations below the transferor (e.g., grandchildren). At a flat 40% rate IN ADDITION to any gift or estate tax, the GSTT can be devastating without proper planning. Strategic use of the GST exemption and careful structuring can eliminate or minimize this tax.

## Effective Dates & Key Law Changes

| Provision | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 and Beyond |
|-----------|------|------|-----------------|
| GST Exemption | $13,610,000 | ~$13,990,000 | ~$7,000,000 (TCJA Sunset) |
| GST Tax Rate | 40% | 40% | 40% |
| Annual Exclusion (GST) | $18,000 | $19,000 | ~$19,000 (indexed) |
| Exemption Portability | None | None | None (GST not portable) |

**CRITICAL 2026 ALERT:** Unlike the estate tax exemption, **GST exemption is NOT portable between spouses**. Each spouse must use their own exemption or lose it at death. The 2026 sunset makes immediate planning essential.

## Key Concepts

### What is a Generation-Skipping Transfer?

**Skip Person Definition:**
- Individual 2+ generations below transferor
- Trust where all beneficiaries are skip persons
- Trust where no non-skip person can receive distributions

**Examples:**
| Transferor | Recipient | Skip Person? |
|------------|-----------|--------------|
| Grandparent | Child | No |
| Grandparent | Grandchild | Yes |
| Grandparent | Great-grandchild | Yes |
| Parent | Child | No |
| Anyone | Unrelated person 37.5+ years younger | Yes |

### Three Types of GSTs

| Type | Description | When Tax Imposed |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **Direct Skip** | Transfer directly to skip person | At transfer |
| **Taxable Distribution** | Distribution from trust to skip person | At distribution |
| **Taxable Termination** | Trust interest terminates, skip persons remain | At termination |

### The GST Tax Impact

**Without GST Planning:**
```
Estate to Grandchild: $10,000,000
Estate Tax (40%): $4,000,000
Remaining: $6,000,000
GST Tax (40% of $6M): $2,400,000
Net to Grandchild: $3,600,000

Effective Rate: 64%
```

**With GST Exemption:**
```
Estate to Grandchild (GST exempt): $10,000,000
Estate Tax: $0 (within exemption)
GST Tax: $0 (exemption allocated)
Net to Grandchild: $10,000,000
```

## GST Exemption Mechanics

### Allocation Rules

**Affirmative Allocation:**
- Taxpayer chooses to allocate on Form 709
- Most control and certainty
- Recommended approach

**Automatic Allocation:**
- Applies to direct skips
- Applies to indirect skips to GST trusts
- Can be turned off
- Don't rely solely on automatic rules

**Deemed Allocation:**
- At death for unused exemption
- IRS allocates to GST transfers
- May not be optimal

### Inclusion Ratio

**Formula:**
```
Inclusion Ratio = 1 - (GST Exemption Allocated / Value of Transfer)
```

**Impact:**
| Inclusion Ratio | GST Tax Rate |
|-----------------|--------------|
| 0.00 | 0% (fully exempt) |
| 0.50 | 20% |
| 1.00 | 40% (fully taxable) |

**Goal:** Inclusion ratio of 0 for all GST transfers

### Exemption Allocation Example

**$20,000,000 transfer to grandchildren's trust:**

| Allocation | Exemption Used | Inclusion Ratio | GST Tax on $20M Distribution |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| Full ($20M) | $20,000,000 | 0.00 | $0 |
| Partial ($10M) | $10,000,000 | 0.50 | $4,000,000 |
| None | $0 | 1.00 | $8,000,000 |

## Requirements

### Form 709 Requirements

**Must File Form 709 For:**
- Direct skips (gifts to grandchildren)
- Transfers to trusts for skip persons
- GST exemption allocation
- Even if no gift tax due

**Include:**
- Part 2 (GST) of Schedule A
- Schedule C (GST exemption allocation)
- Schedule D (if trust transfers)

### Trust GST Status

**GST Trust:** Trust where skip persons may receive distributions

**Determining Trust Status:**
- Identify all potential beneficiaries
- If ANY non-skip beneficiary can receive, NOT a GST trust
- Separate trusts may be needed for different generations

### Annual Exclusion for GST

**Direct skips qualify for annual exclusion if:**
- Present interest gift
- Or Crummey power granted
- Amount: $18,000 (2024), $19,000 (2025)

**Educational/Medical Exclusion:**
- Also exempt from GST
- Must be paid directly to institution
- Unlimited amount

## Client Fit Criteria

### Who Needs GST Planning?

| Situation | GST Planning Priority |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Wealth to grandchildren planned | High |
| Dynasty trust contemplated | Critical |
| Estate over $14M (single) | High |
| Estate over $28M (married) | Critical |
| Pre-deceased child with grandchildren | High |
| Charitable planning to skip persons | Moderate |

### 2025-2026 Planning Urgency

**Must Act Before December 31, 2025:**

| Current Exemption | 2026 Exemption | Lost Opportunity |
|-------------------|----------------|------------------|
| $13,990,000 | ~$7,000,000 | ~$6,990,000 |
| Per couple: $27,980,000 | ~$14,000,000 | ~$13,980,000 |

**Impact of Lost Exemption:**
$13,980,000 × 40% GST = **$5,592,000 in additional GST tax**

## Planning Strategies

### Strategy 1: Use Full Exemption Before 2026

**Action Plan:**
1. Calculate available GST exemption
2. Identify assets for skip-person transfers
3. Create GST-exempt trust(s) in 2025
4. Fund with full exemption amount
5. Properly allocate on Form 709

**Result:** $13.99M+ permanently GST-exempt

### Strategy 2: Leverage Discounted Assets

**Multiply exemption effectiveness:**

| Asset | FMV | Discounted Value | Exemption Used |
|-------|-----|------------------|----------------|
| FLP Interest | $20M | $13M (35% discount) | $13M |
| LLC Interest | $15M | $10M (33% discount) | $10M |
| Remainder Interest | $10M | $5M (actuarial) | $5M |

**Outcome:** Transfer more value with same exemption

### Strategy 3: GST Exempt Dynasty Trust

**Structure:**
- Fund with full GST exemption
- Allocate exemption immediately
- Trust continues for generations
- All growth remains GST-exempt

**See [Dynasty Trusts](dynasty-trusts.md) for details**

### Strategy 4: Reverse QTIP Election

**For married couples with unequal estates:**
1. Wealthy spouse creates QTIP trust for surviving spouse
2. Make reverse QTIP election on Form 706
3. Treat as if transferor spouse for GST purposes
4. Use first spouse's GST exemption

**Benefit:** Ensures both exemptions used (GST not portable)

### Strategy 5: GST Exempt Life Insurance Trust

**Structure:**
- Create ILIT for grandchildren
- Allocate GST exemption to premiums
- Death benefit is GST-exempt
- Multiplies exemption value

**Example:**
- Premiums: $2,000,000 (GST exempt)
- Death benefit: $20,000,000
- All $20,000,000 GST-exempt to grandchildren

### Strategy 6: Annual Exclusion GST Gifts

**Tax-free transfers to grandchildren:**

| Method | Annual Amount (2025) | 10-Year Total |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| Direct gift (present interest) | $19,000 | $190,000 |
| 529 (5-year election) | $95,000 | $190,000 |
| Crummey trust | $19,000 | $190,000 |
| Direct tuition/medical | Unlimited | Unlimited |

**Multiply:** 2 grandparents × 4 grandchildren = 8 annual exclusions

### Strategy 7: Predeceased Ancestor Exception

**If child dies before grandparent:**
- Grandchild moves "up" one generation
- No longer skip person
- No GST tax applies

**Planning Note:** Can't artificially create this, but be aware of impact

## Common GST Mistakes

### Allocation Errors

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Failure to allocate | Trust fully taxable | File Form 709 timely |
| Late allocation | Higher value, less exemption | Allocate at transfer |
| Over-reliance on automatic | May not apply | Affirmatively allocate |
| Wrong trust identified | Misallocation | Review trust terms |

### Structural Errors

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Non-skip beneficiary in trust | Trust not GST trust | Separate trusts by generation |
| Future interest gift | No annual exclusion | Use Crummey powers |
| Wrong inclusion ratio | Unexpected tax | Calculate and verify |

## Case Study

### Scenario
William and Elizabeth, both 68 in 2025:
- Combined estate: $35,000,000
- Three children, six grandchildren
- Want to benefit grandchildren significantly

### Current GST Exposure (Without Planning)

**If transfers at death in 2030 (post-sunset):**
- Estate to grandchildren trust: $10,000,000
- GST exemption (2030, est.): $7,500,000
- Taxable GST amount: $2,500,000
- GST tax: $1,000,000

### Pre-2026 GST Planning

**Action Plan:**

1. **Each spouse creates GST-exempt trust (2025):**
   - William: $13,990,000 to dynasty trust
   - Elizabeth: $13,990,000 to dynasty trust
   - Total GST-exempt: $27,980,000

2. **Asset selection (with discounts):**
   - FLP interests at 30% discount
   - Actual value transferred: ~$40,000,000
   - GST exemption used: $27,980,000

3. **Allocation:**
   - File Form 709 for each spouse
   - Allocate full exemption to each trust
   - Inclusion ratio: 0.00 for both trusts

### Long-Term Results

**After 30 years (6% growth):**

| Metric | Without 2025 Planning | With 2025 Planning |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Trust value | N/A | $229,000,000 |
| GST-exempt | $7,500,000 | $229,000,000 |
| GST tax on distribution | Variable | $0 |
| Estate tax at each gen | 40% | 0% (in trust) |

**Multi-Generational Savings:** $50,000,000+ in GST taxes avoided
