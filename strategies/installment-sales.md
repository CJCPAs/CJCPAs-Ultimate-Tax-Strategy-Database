# Installment Sales (IRC Section 453)

## Overview

An installment sale allows taxpayers to defer recognition of capital gains by receiving payments over multiple years rather than in a lump sum. This strategy spreads the tax liability across the years payments are received, potentially reducing the overall tax burden through bracket management and deferral benefits. Installment sales are particularly valuable for real estate sales, business sales, and other large transactions.

## Effective Dates & Key Law Changes

| Provision | Current Law | 2026 and Beyond |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Capital Gains Rate | 0%/15%/20% + 3.8% NIIT | No change expected |
| Installment Method | Automatic for eligible sales | No change expected |
| Interest Charge (Sec 453A) | >$5M threshold | Indexed for inflation |
| Depreciation Recapture | Recognized in year of sale | No change expected |
| Related Party Rules | 2-year rule | No change expected |

## Key Benefits

- Spread gain recognition over multiple years
- Potential bracket management (stay in lower tax brackets)
- Defer tax, allowing reinvestment of deferred amounts
- Interest income on deferred payments
- Flexibility in structuring transactions
- Estate planning benefits (installment obligations pass to heirs)
- Seller financing can facilitate sales
- Avoid bunching income in single year

### Gross Profit Ratio Calculation

**Key Terms:**
- **Gross Profit:** Selling price - Adjusted basis
- **Contract Price:** Selling price - Mortgages assumed (if exceed basis)
- **Gross Profit Ratio:** Gross Profit ÷ Contract Price

**Example Calculation:**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Selling Price | $1,000,000 |
| Adjusted Basis | $400,000 |
| **Gross Profit** | **$600,000** |
| Contract Price | $1,000,000 |
| **Gross Profit Ratio** | **60%** |

**Each $100,000 Payment:**
- Principal portion: $100,000
- Gain recognized: $100,000 × 60% = $60,000
- Return of basis: $100,000 × 40% = $40,000

### Payment Components

| Payment Component | Tax Treatment |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Interest | Ordinary income |
| Principal - Gain portion | Capital gain (usually) |
| Principal - Basis portion | Tax-free return of capital |

## Requirements

### Eligible Sales

**Qualifies for Installment Method:**
- Real property
- Personal property (non-inventory)
- Business sales
- At least one payment after year of sale

**Does NOT Qualify:**
- Inventory sales
- Dealer property (held for sale to customers)
- Publicly traded securities
- Depreciation recapture (recognized immediately)

### Related Party Rules (Section 453(e))

**Related Party Definition:**
- Family members (spouse, children, grandchildren, parents)
- Controlled corporations (>50%)
- Controlled partnerships
- Trusts where taxpayer is beneficiary

**2-Year Disposition Rule:**
If related party sells property within 2 years:
- Seller's deferred gain accelerated
- Exceptions for involuntary conversions, death

### Minimum Interest Requirements

**Applicable Federal Rate (AFR):**
Must charge at least AFR or imputed interest applies

| Term | AFR (Example Dec 2024) |
|------|----------------------|
| Short-term (≤3 years) | ~4.5% |
| Mid-term (3-9 years) | ~4.2% |
| Long-term (>9 years) | ~4.4% |

**Below-market loans:** Interest imputed, potential gift consequences

### Depreciation Recapture

**Section 1245 Property (Equipment):**
- ALL depreciation recapture recognized in year of sale
- Cannot defer under installment method

**Section 1250 Property (Real Estate):**
- Only unrecaptured Section 1250 gain (25% rate)

## Client Fit Criteria

### Ideal Candidates

| Characteristic | Why Favorable |
|----------------|---------------|
| Large gain in single year | Avoid bracket spike |
| Retiring business owner | Spread income over retirement |
| Real estate investor | Common transaction type |
| Need seller financing | Creates terms for buyer |
| Estate planning goals | Pass installment notes to heirs |
| Expecting lower future income | Recognize gain when rates lower |

### Installment Sale Suitability

| Gain Amount | Installment Benefit |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Under $100,000 | Minimal (costs may exceed benefit) |
| $100,000 - $500,000 | Moderate (bracket management) |
| $500,000 - $2,000,000 | Significant (substantial deferral) |
| Over $2,000,000 | High (but consider 453A interest) |

### When NOT to Use Installment

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Need all cash immediately | Can't use installment |
| Loss on sale | No benefit (losses recognized immediately) |
| Low gain, simple transaction | Administrative burden |
| Very large sale (>$5M deferred) | Section 453A interest charge |
| Related party planning to resell | 2-year rule issues |
| Depreciation recapture is most of gain | Can't defer anyway |

**Sale of Commercial Building:**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Selling Price | $2,000,000 |
| Original Cost | $1,500,000 |
| Accumulated Depreciation | $500,000 |
| Adjusted Basis | $1,000,000 |
| Total Gain | $1,000,000 |

**Terms:**
- Down payment: $200,000
- Balance: $1,800,000 over 10 years
- Interest: 5% annually

**Year 1 Recognition:**

| Item | Amount | Tax Rate |
|------|--------|----------|
| Down payment | $200,000 | |
| × Gross profit ratio | 50% | |
| = Gain recognized | $100,000 | |
| - Unrecaptured 1250 | ($100,000) | 25% |
| - Capital gain | $0 | 20% |

**Years 2-11 Recognition (Each Year):**

| Item | Amount | Tax Rate |
|------|--------|----------|
| Principal payment | $180,000 | |
| × Gross profit ratio | 50% | |
| = Gain recognized | $90,000 | |
| Allocation: | | |
| - Unrecaptured 1250 | $44,444* | 25% |
| - Capital gain | $45,556 | 20% |

*Until $500,000 Section 1250 fully recognized

**Interest Income:** Taxed as ordinary income each year

### Comparison: Lump Sum vs. Installment

**$1,000,000 Gain, Taxpayer in 35% Ordinary/20% Capital:**

| Method | Year 1 Tax | Years 2-10 Tax | Total Tax | NPV of Tax |
|--------|------------|----------------|-----------|------------|
| Lump sum | $200,000+* | $0 | ~$200,000 | $200,000 |
| Installment | ~$42,000 | ~$18,000/yr | ~$204,000 | ~$165,000 |

*Includes 25% recapture + 20% capital gains + 3.8% NIIT + state

**Deferral Benefit:** ~$35,000 in tax savings (NPV)

## Special Rules

### Section 453A Interest Charge

**Applies When:**
- Face amount of ALL installment obligations
- From NON-dealer sales
- Exceeds $5,000,000 (indexed)

**Interest Charge Calculation:**
- On deferred tax attributable to obligations over $5M
- Interest rate = underpayment rate
- Reported annually

**Planning:** Structure multiple sales to stay under threshold

### Electing Out of Installment Method

**When to Elect Out:**
- Expecting higher tax rates in future
- Need to use losses in current year
- Want to recognize gain for other purposes
- AMT planning

**How to Elect:**
- Report full gain on return for year of sale
- Irrevocable election
- Must be made on timely filed return

### Contingent Payment Sales

**When sale price depends on future events:**
- Maximum selling price rule
- No maximum price rule
- Fixed payment period rule

**Complex rules—consult specialist**

### Disposition of Installment Obligations

| Disposition | Tax Treatment |
|-------------|---------------|
| Sale of note | Gain/loss recognized |
| Gift of note | Gain recognized by donor |
| Bequest at death | Stepped-up basis (IRD) |
| Cancellation | Gain recognized |
| Default/repossession | Special rules apply |

## Estate Planning Applications

### Installment Sale to Grantor Trust (IDGT)

**Powerful combination:**
1. Sell appreciated asset to IDGT
2. Receive installment note
3. Interest payments to grantor trust not taxable (grantor trust)
4. Asset appreciation outside estate
5. Note payments reduce estate further

**See [IDGTs](idgts.md) for details**

### Self-Canceling Installment Note (SCIN)

**Structure:**
- Installment note that cancels at seller's death
- Premium interest rate or price for mortality risk
- If seller dies, note cancelled—no estate inclusion
- If seller lives, full payment received

**Risk:** Seller must die during note term to benefit

### Private Annuity (Limited Use Post-2006)

**Note:** Regulations made private annuities less attractive
- Gain recognized upfront (not deferred)
- Limited planning applications remain

## Case Study
