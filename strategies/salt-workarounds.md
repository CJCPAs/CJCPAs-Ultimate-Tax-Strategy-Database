# SALT Workarounds: Pass-Through Entity Tax Elections

## Overview

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 originally capped the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction at $10,000 for individuals. The **One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)** of 2025 increased this cap to **$40,000 for 2025-2029**, with income-based phase-outs. Despite the higher cap, Pass-Through Entity (PTE) tax elections remain valuable for high-income business owners, particularly those above the phase-out thresholds. PTE elections allow S corporations, partnerships, and LLCs to pay state income tax at the entity level, effectively bypassing the SALT cap entirely.

## Effective Dates & Key Law Changes (OBBBA Update)

| Provision | TCJA (2018-2024) | OBBBA (2025-2029) | 2030+ |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|-------|
| SALT Cap | $10,000 | **$40,000** | TBD (may revert) |
| Phase-out Start | None | $500,000 AGI | TBD |
| Phase-out Complete | None | $600,000 AGI | TBD |
| PTE Workaround | Highly valuable | Still valuable (especially high income) | TBD |

**OBBBA SALT Phase-Out Rules (2025-2029):**
- Full $40,000 cap: AGI under $500,000
- Reduced cap: AGI $500,000-$600,000 (phases out ratably)
- No SALT deduction: AGI over $600,000
- PTE election bypasses these limits entirely

## Key Benefits

- Bypass SALT deduction cap (now $40,000, or phase-out limitations)
- Full deduction for state taxes at entity level
- IRS approved (Notice 2020-75)
- Available in 35+ states
- Critical for taxpayers above $500,000 AGI (phase-out zone)
- Essential for taxpayers above $600,000 AGI (no SALT without PTE)
- Can be combined with other strategies

## How SALT Workarounds Work

### The Problem (SALT Cap & Phase-Outs)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Traditional Structure (2025+)                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  S Corp/Partnership Income → Pass-through to Owner              │
│  Owner pays state tax personally                                │
│  SALT Deduction: LIMITED TO $40,000 (2025-2029)                │
│  Phase-out: $500K-$600K AGI (reduced cap)                       │
│  Above $600K AGI: NO SALT deduction at all                      │
│  Lost deduction on state taxes over cap                         │

### The Solution (PTE Election)

├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  S Corp/Partnership makes PTE election                          │
│  Entity pays state tax directly                                 │
│  State tax is business expense → FULLY DEDUCTIBLE              │
│  Owner receives state tax credit on personal return             │
│  Bypasses SALT cap entirely                                     │

|-------|-------|
| Texas | No state income tax |
| Florida | No state income tax |
| Nevada | No state income tax |
| Washington | No state income tax (capital gains tax exists) |
| Wyoming | No state income tax |

## Tax Savings Calculation

### When PTE Election Matters Most (Post-OBBBA)

| AGI Level | SALT Cap Available | PTE Benefit |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Under $500,000 | $40,000 | Moderate (if state tax > $40K) |
| $500,000-$600,000 | Reduced (phases out) | High |
| Over $600,000 | **$0** | **Critical** |

### Basic Example (AGI Over $600K - No SALT Without PTE)

**Business owner in California (AGI $800,000):**
- S Corp net income: $800,000
- California tax rate: 9.3%
- State tax: $74,400
- AGI above $600K = NO SALT deduction allowed

**Without PTE Election:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| State tax paid personally | $74,400 |
| SALT deduction | **$0** (above phase-out) |
| Lost deduction | $74,400 |
| Federal tax on lost deduction (37%) | $27,528 |

**With PTE Election:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| State tax paid by entity | $74,400 |
| Entity deduction (business expense) | $74,400 |
| Federal taxable income reduction | $74,400 |
| Federal tax savings (37%) | $27,528 |

**Net Benefit: $27,528 annually**

### Example (AGI Under $500K - Still Beneficial if High State Tax)

**Business owner in California (AGI $400,000):**
- S Corp net income: $400,000
- California tax rate: 9.3%
- State tax: $37,200
- Property taxes: $15,000
- Total SALT: $52,200

**Without PTE Election:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Total state/local taxes | $52,200 |
| SALT deduction | $40,000 (capped) |
| Lost deduction | $12,200 |
| Federal tax on lost deduction (37%) | $4,514 |

**With PTE Election:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| State tax paid by entity | $37,200 |
| Entity deduction (business expense) | $37,200 |
| Property taxes (personal) | $15,000 |
| Personal SALT deduction | $15,000 |
| Full benefit captured | Yes |
| Federal tax savings | $4,514 |

**Net Benefit: $4,514 annually**

### Detailed Calculation (High-Income NY Taxpayer)

**Assumptions:**
- Married filing jointly
- $900,000 S Corp income (AGI well above $600K)
- New York resident (10.9% state rate)
- Other SALT: $25,000 (property taxes)

**State Tax:**
$900,000 × 10.9% = $98,100

**Without PTE:**
- AGI above $600K = NO SALT deduction
- $98,100 + $25,000 = $123,100 in state/local taxes
- SALT deduction = $0
- Lost benefit: $123,100 × 37% = $45,547

**With PTE:**
- Entity deducts $98,100 as business expense
- Federal taxable income: $900,000 - $98,100 = $801,900
- Tax savings: $98,100 × 37% = $36,297
- Property taxes still not deductible personally (AGI too high)

**Net Benefit: $36,297 annually**

## Requirements

### Eligible Entities

| Entity Type | Eligible? | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| S Corporation | Yes | Most common |
| Partnership | Yes | Includes multi-member LLCs |
| LLC (multi-member) | Yes | Taxed as partnership |
| LLC (single-member) | Usually No | Disregarded entity |
| C Corporation | No | Already pays entity-level tax |
| Sole Proprietorship | No | Not a pass-through entity |

### Election Requirements (Vary by State)

**Common Requirements:**
- Annual election (irrevocable for year)
- Election deadline (varies: before year-end or with return)
- All or substantially all owners must consent
- Timely payment of estimated taxes
- Modified K-1 reporting

### Owner Credit Mechanism

**How owners recover tax paid by entity:**

1. Entity pays state PTE tax
2. Entity deducts as business expense (reduces K-1 income)
3. Owner reports lower K-1 income on federal return
4. Owner claims credit on state personal return for PTE tax paid
5. Credit offsets personal state tax liability

**Net Effect:** Owner pays same state tax but gets federal benefit

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Evaluate Eligibility

**Checklist:**
- [ ] State offers PTE election
- [ ] Entity is S Corp, partnership, or LLC
- [ ] All owners agree to election
- [ ] Benefits exceed costs/complexity

### Step 2: Make Election

**Timing varies by state:**
| State | Election Deadline |
|-------|-------------------|
| California | On original timely-filed return |
| New York | By March 15 of tax year |
| New Jersey | On or before original due date |
| Illinois | Same date as return |

### Step 3: Pay Estimated Taxes

**Most states require entity-level estimates:**
- Quarterly or annual payments
- Penalties for underpayment
- Calculate based on projected income

### Step 4: File Returns

**Entity return:**
- Report PTE tax as expense
- Issue modified K-1s showing tax paid
- File PTE-specific forms (varies by state)

**Personal return:**
- Report K-1 income (reduced by PTE tax)
- Claim state credit for PTE tax paid
- Attach state credit form

### Step 5: Document and Track

**Maintain records:**
- Election documentation
- Estimated tax payments
- K-1s with PTE information
- State credit claims

## State-Specific Considerations

### California

**Key Features:**
- 9.3% flat rate on qualified income
- Credit limited to 93% in first year (not fully refundable)
- Must elect annually
- Available 2021-2025 (unless extended)

**Limitations:**
- Cannot reduce federal taxable income below zero
- Guaranteed payments not included
- S Corp reasonable compensation not included

### New York

**Key Features:**
- Progressive rates up to 10.9%
- Resident credit for non-NY source PTE tax
- Election by March 15 of tax year
- Estimated payments required

### New Jersey

**Key Features:**
- Rate matches personal rates (up to 10.75%)
- Full credit against personal liability
- Election with original return
- All members must consent

### Multi-State Considerations

**If business operates in multiple states:**
- May need elections in each PTE state
- Resident state credit for taxes paid to other states
- Complex allocation and apportionment
- Professional guidance recommended

## Risks & Considerations

### Complexity

**Added requirements:**
- Additional state filings
- Estimated tax calculations at entity level
- Modified K-1 preparation
- Credit tracking for owners
- Multi-state coordination

### Cash Flow Impact

**Entity pays tax:**
- May need to adjust distributions
- Quarterly estimates required
- Timing differences possible

### Non-Participating Owners

**If some owners don't benefit:**
- Trusts as owners (may not get credit)
- Non-resident owners (credit issues)
- Tax-exempt owners
- May need consent mechanism

### State Law Changes

**Ongoing monitoring:**
- States may modify or eliminate provisions
- Federal conformity not guaranteed
- Annual compliance review needed

### Interaction with Other Rules

**Consider impact on:**
- Qualified Business Income (199A) deduction
- At-risk and passive loss rules
- Alternative Minimum Tax
- State-specific credits and deductions

## Case Study

### Scenario
Dr. Sarah Chen operates her medical practice as an S Corporation in California:
- S Corp net income: $800,000
- Reasonable salary: $300,000
- Pass-through income: $500,000
- Property taxes: $15,000
- Marginal federal rate: 37%

### Without PTE Election

| Item | Calculation | Amount |
|------|-------------|--------|
| California tax on pass-through | $500,000 × 9.3% | $46,500 |
| Personal SALT deduction | Capped | $10,000 |
| Lost SALT deduction | $46,500 + $15,000 - $10,000 | $51,500 |
| Federal tax cost | $51,500 × 37% | $19,055 |

### With PTE Election

| Item | Calculation | Amount |
|------|-------------|--------|
| CA PTE tax (entity pays) | $500,000 × 9.3% | $46,500 |
| Entity deduction | Business expense | $46,500 |
| Reduced K-1 income | $500,000 - $46,500 | $453,500 |
| Federal tax savings | $46,500 × 37% | $17,205 |
| State credit | Offsets personal CA tax | $46,500 |

### Annual Savings

| Metric | Without PTE | With PTE | Savings |
|--------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Federal taxable income | $500,000 | $453,500 | |
| Federal tax | $185,000 | $167,795 | $17,205 |
| State tax (net) | $46,500 | $46,500 | $0 |
| **Net savings** | | | **$17,205/year** |

### 10-Year Benefit
$17,205 × 10 years = **$172,050** in federal tax savings
