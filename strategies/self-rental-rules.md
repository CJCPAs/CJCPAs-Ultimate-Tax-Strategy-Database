# Self-Rental Rules and Recharacterization

## Overview

The self-rental rules under IRC Section 469 recharacterize rental income as non-passive when a taxpayer rents property to a business in which they materially participate. This rule was designed to prevent taxpayers from generating passive income to absorb passive losses. Understanding these rules is essential for business owners who rent property to their own businesses.

## Effective Dates & Key Law Changes

| Provision | Current Law | 2026 and Beyond |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Self-Rental Recharacterization | Active | No change expected |
| Material Participation Tests | 7 tests apply | No change expected |
| Passive Loss Limitations | $25,000 rental exception | No change expected |
| Grouping Elections | Available | No change expected |
| Section 199A QBI | Available | Scheduled to expire |

**Planning Note:** The self-rental rules are permanent and not affected by TCJA sunset provisions.

## Key Concepts

### The Self-Rental Rule

**Basic Rule (Treas. Reg. 1.469-2(f)(6)):**

When you rent property to a business in which you materially participate:
- Rental **income** is recharacterized as **non-passive**
- Rental **losses** remain **passive**

**The Asymmetry Problem:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│             SELF-RENTAL RECHARACTERIZATION                  │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                             │
│  Rental Income → Recharacterized as NON-PASSIVE             │
│  (Cannot offset passive losses from other properties)       │
│                                                             │
│  Rental Losses → Remain PASSIVE                             │
│  (Can only offset passive income)                           │
│                                                             │
│  Result: Worst of both worlds for taxpayer                  │
│                                                             │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### When Self-Rental Rules Apply

**All conditions must be met:**
1. Property is rented to entity
2. Entity conducts trade or business
3. Taxpayer has ownership in both property and entity
4. Taxpayer materially participates in entity's business

### Self-Rental Examples

| Scenario | Self-Rental? | Result |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Doctor rents office to own medical practice (S-Corp) | Yes | Income recharacterized |
| Landlord rents to unrelated tenant | No | Normal rental rules |
| Partner rents building to partnership (materially participates) | Yes | Income recharacterized |
| Shareholder rents equipment to C-Corp | Depends on participation | May be recharacterized |
| Renting to business, no material participation | No | Remains passive |

## Tax Impact

### Scenario Analysis

**Without Self-Rental Recharacterization:**
| Item | Amount | Treatment |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Rental income from business | $50,000 | Passive |
| Other passive losses | ($60,000) | Passive |
| Net passive | ($10,000) | Suspended |
| Non-passive income offset | $0 | N/A |

**With Self-Rental Recharacterization:**
| Item | Amount | Treatment |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Rental income from business | $50,000 | **Non-passive** |
| Other passive losses | ($60,000) | Passive (suspended) |
| Net result | $50,000 taxable | Cannot offset |

**Tax Cost:** $50,000 × 37% = **$18,500 additional tax**

### The Real Problem

**Taxpayer has:**
- Self-rental income: $50,000 (now non-passive)
- Rental losses (other properties): $60,000 (passive)
- W-2 income: $300,000 (non-passive)

**Expected:** Rental income + losses = net $10,000 passive loss (suspended)
**Actual:** $50,000 taxable income + $60,000 suspended losses = **$50,000 extra taxable income**

## Requirements

### Material Participation in Business

**Must meet at least ONE of the seven tests:**

| Test | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| 500-Hour Test | 500+ hours during year |
| Substantially All | Participation is substantially all |
| 100 Hours + Most | 100+ hours AND more than anyone else |
| Significant Participation | Multiple activities totaling 500+ hours |
| Five-Year Test | Material participation in 5 of prior 10 years |
| Personal Service | 3 of prior 10 years (for PSCs) |
| Facts & Circumstances | Regular, continuous, substantial |

### What Triggers the Rule

**Self-rental exists when:**
1. Renting to a partnership in which you're a partner
2. Renting to an S-Corp where you're a shareholder
3. Renting to a C-Corp where you're a shareholder (with material participation in activities)
4. Any rental to business with common ownership and participation

### What Doesn't Trigger the Rule

| Situation | Why Not Self-Rental |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Rent to unrelated party | No common ownership |
| Rent to business, but don't materially participate | No material participation |
| Property is not rental (Schedule C) | Different rules apply |
| Triple-net lease with no services | May avoid (but carefully analyze) |

## Client Fit Criteria

### Who Faces Self-Rental Issues

| Business Owner Type | Common Self-Rental Setup |
|--------------------|-------------------------|
| Medical professionals | Office building rented to practice |
| Attorneys | Law office rented to firm |
| Manufacturers | Factory rented to operating company |
| Retailers | Store building rented to business |
| Restaurants | Restaurant building rented to operating entity |
| Service businesses | Office/equipment rented to S-Corp |

### Red Flags for Self-Rental

| Indicator | Planning Needed |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Own property personally | Consider entity structure |
| Rent to own S-Corp/Partnership | Review material participation |
| Have other passive losses | Need income to absorb |
| High rental income from self-rental | Large recharacterization impact |

## Planning Strategies

### Strategy 1: Grouping Election

**Aggregate rental and business as single activity:**

**Requirements:**
- Appropriate economic unit
- Same ownership
- Common control
- Valid business purpose

**Benefits:**
- Rental becomes part of business activity
- Single material participation determination
- Losses and income net together

**How to Elect:**
- Statement attached to tax return
- First year property rented to business
- Identify grouped activities
- Once made, binding unless material change

**Example:**
```
Before Grouping:
- Business activity: $200,000 income (non-passive if MP)
- Self-rental: $50,000 income → non-passive
- Other rentals: ($60,000) loss → passive
- Result: $250,000 taxable, $60,000 suspended

After Grouping (rental + business):
- Combined activity: $250,000 income (non-passive)
- Other rentals: ($60,000) passive (still suspended)
- Result: Same, BUT if rental has losses, now combined
```

**Best Use:** When rental activity has potential for losses

### Strategy 2: Avoid Material Participation

**If no material participation in business:**
- Self-rental rule doesn't apply
- Rental remains passive
- Can offset passive income

**Practical Challenges:**
- Hard to not participate in own business
- Must document carefully
- May conflict with other goals (199A, etc.)

### Strategy 3: Real Estate Professional Status

**If qualifying as Real Estate Professional:**
- Rental activity can be non-passive
- Self-rental recharacterization less impactful
- All real estate activities treated consistently

**Requirements:**
- 750+ hours in real estate trades/businesses
- More than half of personal service time in RE
- Material participation in each rental (or grouping election)

### Strategy 4: C-Corporation Ownership

**C-Corp rental considerations:**
- Material participation test more complex
- May not trigger self-rental if:
  - C-Corp conducts business
  - Shareholder doesn't materially participate in C-Corp activities

**Caution:** Other tax implications of C-Corp structure

### Strategy 5: Structure Property in Entity

**Hold rental in separate LLC:**
- May still trigger self-rental
- But provides liability protection
- Entity structure doesn't avoid rule alone

**Better Structure:**
- Consider different ownership percentages
- Ensure legitimate business purpose
- Document all arrangements

### Strategy 6: Convert to Non-Rental

**If property provides significant services:**
- May not be "rental" for 469 purposes
- Trade or business instead
- Different passive activity rules

**Services that may convert:**
- Significant personal services (hotel-like)
- Property provided incidental to services
- Average rental less than 7 days

## Grouping Election Details

### Making the Election

**Required Statement Elements:**
1. Names, addresses, EINs of grouped activities
2. Activities being grouped
3. Declaration this is appropriate economic unit
4. First year for which grouping is effective

**Timing:**
- File with original return for first applicable year
- Cannot make retroactively
- Binding once made

### Example Grouping Statement

```
GROUPING ELECTION UNDER TREAS. REG. 1.469-4

Taxpayer: John Smith, SSN XXX-XX-XXXX
Tax Year: 2025

The taxpayer elects to treat the following activities as a
single activity under Treas. Reg. 1.469-4(c):

1. ABC Medical Practice, S-Corporation
   EIN: XX-XXXXXXX
   Nature: Medical practice

2. Medical Office Building LLC
   EIN: XX-XXXXXXX
   Nature: Rental real estate (office building rented to
   ABC Medical Practice)

These activities constitute an appropriate economic unit
based on common ownership, common control, and the
integrated nature of the business operations.

This election is effective for tax year 2025 and all
subsequent years unless there is a material change in
facts and circumstances.
```

### When Grouping Helps

| Situation | Grouping Benefit |
|-----------|------------------|
| Rental has losses | Losses offset business income |
| Rental has income, business has losses | Can net together |
| Simplify material participation | One determination |
| Consistent economic unit | Matches reality |

### When Grouping Hurts

| Situation | Potential Downside |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Want passive income | Grouping makes it non-passive |
| Separating later | Limited ability to ungroup |
| Different owners | May not be appropriate economic unit |
| Different locations | Harder to justify grouping |

## Case Study

### Scenario

Dr. Sarah Chen:
- Medical practice (S-Corp): $400,000 net income
- Owns office building personally
- Rents building to her S-Corp: $60,000/year
- Building expenses/depreciation: $40,000
- Net rental income: $20,000
- Other rental property (apartment): ($30,000) passive loss
- Materially participates in medical practice (2,000+ hours)

### Without Planning (Self-Rental Applied)

| Item | Amount | Character |
|------|--------|-----------|
| S-Corp K-1 | $400,000 | Non-passive |
| Self-rental income | $20,000 | **Recharacterized non-passive** |
| Apartment rental loss | ($30,000) | Passive (suspended) |
| **Taxable** | **$420,000** | |

**Problem:** $30,000 passive loss suspended, cannot offset $20,000 self-rental income

### With Grouping Election

**Group medical practice + office building:**

| Item | Amount | Character |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Grouped activity (S-Corp + building) | $420,000 | Non-passive |
| Apartment rental loss | ($30,000) | Passive (suspended) |
| **Taxable** | **$420,000** | |

**Result:** Same in this case—grouping doesn't help when rental is profitable and no business losses

### Better Scenario for Grouping

**If building had losses (e.g., major repairs):**

| Without Grouping | With Grouping |
|------------------|---------------|
| S-Corp: $400,000 (non-passive) | Combined: $370,000 (non-passive) |
| Building: ($30,000) (passive) | |
| Taxable: $400,000 | Taxable: $370,000 |

**Benefit:** $30,000 building loss offsets S-Corp income

### Planning Recommendation for Dr. Chen

1. **Make grouping election** for future flexibility
2. **Consider cost segregation** on office building
   - Generate significant depreciation losses
   - Grouped losses offset business income
3. **REPS status** if feasible (unlikely given medical practice hours)
4. **Document** material participation in practice

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Ignoring self-rental rules | Unexpected tax | Analyze rental arrangements |
| Not making grouping election timely | Missed opportunity | Elect in first applicable year |
| Improper grouping | IRS recharacterization | Ensure appropriate economic unit |
| No documentation | Burden of proof issues | Written records |
| Assuming C-Corp avoids rule | May still apply | Analyze participation carefully |
| Forgetting about prior-year elections | Inconsistent positions | Track all elections |
