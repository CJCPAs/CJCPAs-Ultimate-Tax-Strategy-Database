## Key Benefits

- Flexibility in profit distribution
- Improved succession and exit planning options

## Entity Types Comparison

|-------------|--------------|--------|---------------------|------------|
| Sole Proprietorship | Pass-through | Full | None | Low |
| Single-Member LLC | Pass-through | Full | Yes | Low |
| Partnership/Multi-Member LLC | Pass-through | Variable | Yes | Medium |
| S Corporation | Pass-through | On wages only | Yes | Medium |
| C Corporation | Double taxation | None | Yes | High |

## Requirements

## Implementation Steps

### Converting to S Corporation

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - Calculate current self-employment tax burden
   - Project reasonable compensation requirements
   - Evaluate state-level S corporation treatment
   - Assess compliance costs vs. tax savings

2. **Formation/Conversion**
   - Form corporation or convert existing LLC
   - File Form 2553 (S Election) with IRS
   - Establish corporate minutes and records
   - Set up payroll system

3. **Ongoing Compliance**
   - Process regular payroll (minimum quarterly)
   - File quarterly payroll tax returns (Form 941)
   - File annual S Corporation return (Form 1120-S)
   - Issue K-1s to shareholders
   - Maintain reasonable compensation documentation

### Establishing Multi-Entity Structure

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Identify distinct business activities
   - Evaluate liability isolation needs
   - Consider state tax implications
   - Model tax savings scenarios

2. **Implementation**
   - Form separate entities for each business line
   - Draft intercompany agreements
   - Establish management company if applicable
   - Set up proper accounting between entities

3. **Maintenance**
   - Maintain arm's length transactions
   - Document intercompany pricing
   - File consolidated or separate returns as required
   - Annual review of structure effectiveness

## Risks & Considerations

### S Corporation Risks
- **Reasonable Compensation Audits**: IRS scrutinizes low officer compensation
- **Payroll Tax Penalties**: Failure to remit payroll taxes carries personal liability
- **Built-In Gains Tax**: Converting C to S may trigger gains on appreciated assets
- **State Variations**: Some states don't recognize S status (e.g., NYC, DC)

### Multi-Entity Risks
- **Economic Substance**: Entities must have valid business purpose
- **Intercompany Pricing**: Must reflect arm's length transactions
- **Piercing Corporate Veil**: Failure to maintain separateness risks liability exposure
- **Administrative Burden**: Multiple returns, payrolls, and bank accounts

### General Considerations
- **Conversion Costs**: Legal, accounting, and administrative expenses
- **Phantom Income**: Pass-through entities may distribute less than tax liability
- **Exit Complexity**: Entity choice affects business sale treatment

## Case Study

### Scenario
Sarah operates a consulting business as a sole proprietor with $200,000 net income.

### Current Situation
- Self-employment tax: $200,000 × 15.3% × 92.35% = $28,261
- Total SE tax burden: $28,261

### After S Corporation Election
- Reasonable salary: $100,000
- FICA taxes on salary: $100,000 × 7.65% = $7,650 (employee portion)
- Employer FICA: $7,650
- Remaining $100,000 distributed as non-SE income

### Annual Savings
- Previous SE tax: $28,261
- New FICA cost: $15,300 total
- **Net savings: $12,961 per year**

## Effective Dates

| Provision | Effective Date | Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| S Corporation Election | Subchapter S Revision Act 1982 | Permanent |
| LLC/Partnership Taxation | Check-the-box regulations 1997 | Permanent |
| C Corporation 21% Rate | January 1, 2018 (TCJA) | Permanent |
| QSBS 100% Exclusion | After September 27, 2010 | Permanent |
| Section 199A Pass-through Deduction | January 1, 2018 | Expires December 31, 2025 (unless extended) |

**2026 Tax Year Considerations**:
- S corporation election remains beneficial for self-employment tax savings.
- **Critical**: Section 199A pass-through deduction expires after 2025 unless Congress extends it. This may significantly impact the comparison between entity types.
- C corporation 21% rate is permanent and may become relatively more attractive if Section 199A expires.
- Monitor legislative developments regarding TCJA extension.
