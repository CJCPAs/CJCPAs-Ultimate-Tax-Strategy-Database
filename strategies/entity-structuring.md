# Entity Structuring

## Overview

Entity structuring involves selecting and organizing the optimal legal business structure to minimize tax liability while achieving business objectives. The choice of entity affects income taxes, self-employment taxes, liability protection, and succession planning.

## Key Benefits

- Reduced overall tax burden through strategic entity selection
- Self-employment tax savings (potentially $20,000+ annually)
- Enhanced liability protection
- Flexibility in profit distribution
- Improved succession and exit planning options

## Entity Types Comparison

| Entity Type | Tax Treatment | SE Tax | Liability Protection | Complexity |
|-------------|--------------|--------|---------------------|------------|
| Sole Proprietorship | Pass-through | Full | None | Low |
| Single-Member LLC | Pass-through | Full | Yes | Low |
| Partnership/Multi-Member LLC | Pass-through | Variable | Yes | Medium |
| S Corporation | Pass-through | On wages only | Yes | Medium |
| C Corporation | Double taxation | None | Yes | High |

## Requirements

## Implementation Steps

### Converting to S Corporation

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - Calculate current self-employment tax burden
   - Project reasonable compensation requirements
   - Evaluate state-level S corporation treatment
   - Assess compliance costs vs. tax savings

2. **Formation/Conversion**
   - Form corporation or convert existing LLC
   - File Form 2553 (S Election) with IRS
   - Establish corporate minutes and records
   - Set up payroll system

3. **Ongoing Compliance**
   - Process regular payroll (minimum quarterly)
   - File quarterly payroll tax returns (Form 941)
   - File annual S Corporation return (Form 1120-S)
   - Issue K-1s to shareholders
   - Maintain reasonable compensation documentation

### Establishing Multi-Entity Structure

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Identify distinct business activities
   - Evaluate liability isolation needs
   - Consider state tax implications
   - Model tax savings scenarios

2. **Implementation**
   - Form separate entities for each business line
   - Draft intercompany agreements
   - Establish management company if applicable
   - Set up proper accounting between entities

3. **Maintenance**
   - Maintain arm's length transactions
   - Document intercompany pricing
   - File consolidated or separate returns as required
   - Annual review of structure effectiveness

## Risks & Considerations

### S Corporation Risks
- **Reasonable Compensation Audits**: IRS scrutinizes low officer compensation
- **Payroll Tax Penalties**: Failure to remit payroll taxes carries personal liability
- **Built-In Gains Tax**: Converting C to S may trigger gains on appreciated assets
- **State Variations**: Some states don't recognize S status (e.g., NYC, DC)

### Multi-Entity Risks
- **Economic Substance**: Entities must have valid business purpose
- **Intercompany Pricing**: Must reflect arm's length transactions
- **Piercing Corporate Veil**: Failure to maintain separateness risks liability exposure
- **Administrative Burden**: Multiple returns, payrolls, and bank accounts

### General Considerations
- **Conversion Costs**: Legal, accounting, and administrative expenses
- **Phantom Income**: Pass-through entities may distribute less than tax liability
- **Exit Complexity**: Entity choice affects business sale treatment

## Case Study

### Scenario
Sarah operates a consulting business as a sole proprietor with $200,000 net income. She's in the 32% marginal tax bracket.

### Current Situation (Sole Proprietor)
- Self-employment tax: $200,000 × 15.3% × 92.35% = $28,261
- Section 199A QBI deduction (23%): $200,000 × 23% = $46,000
- Tax savings from 199A: $46,000 × 32% = $14,720
- **Net SE tax after 199A benefit: $28,261**

### After S Corporation Election
- Reasonable salary: $100,000
- FICA taxes on salary: $100,000 × 7.65% = $7,650 (employee portion)
- Employer FICA: $7,650
- Remaining $100,000 distributed as non-SE income
- Section 199A QBI deduction on pass-through: $100,000 × 23% = $23,000
- Tax savings from 199A: $23,000 × 32% = $7,360

### Annual Savings Analysis
| Item | Sole Prop | S Corp |
|------|-----------|--------|
| SE Tax / FICA | $28,261 | $15,300 |
| 199A QBI Deduction | $46,000 | $23,000 |
| 199A Tax Savings | $14,720 | $7,360 |

**SE/FICA Savings:** $28,261 - $15,300 = **$12,961**
**Lost 199A Benefit:** $14,720 - $7,360 = **$7,360**
**Net Annual Savings:** $12,961 - $7,360 = **$5,601**

**Note:** The S Corp election reduces QBI (salary is excluded), but SE tax savings still exceed the lost 199A benefit. At higher income levels, S Corp benefits increase further.

- Section 199A is now **permanent at 23%**—reduces relative S Corp benefit but still valuable
- C corporation 21% rate is permanent; pass-through still generally preferred for most businesses
- Entity choice analysis should compare 23% QBI deduction vs. SE tax savings
