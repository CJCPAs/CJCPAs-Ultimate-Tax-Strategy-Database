# Portability Elections (DSUE)

## Overview

Portability allows a surviving spouse to use the deceased spouse's unused estate and gift tax exemption (DSUE - Deceased Spouse's Unused Exclusion). This effectively allows married couples to transfer up to twice the individual exemption amount without estate tax. However, portability requires an affirmative election on a timely filed estate tax return—even when no estate tax is due.

## Effective Dates & Key Law Changes

| Provision | Pre-OBBBA (2024-2025) | Post-OBBBA (July 2025+) |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Estate/Gift Tax Exemption | $13.61M (2024) / ~$13.99M (2025) | **$15M permanent** (indexed) |
| Estate Tax Rate | 40% | 40% |
| Portability Available | Yes | Yes |
| GST Exemption Portable | **NO** | **NO** |
| Filing Deadline | 2 years (simplified) / 5 years (Rev. Proc. 2022-32) | Same |

**OBBBA Impact (July 4, 2025):** The One Big Beautiful Bill Act made the estate and gift tax exemption permanent at $15M per person ($30M for married couples), indexed for inflation. This eliminates the previous TCJA sunset that would have reduced the exemption to ~$7M in 2026. Portability remains valuable for preserving a deceased spouse's unused exemption, potentially allowing couples to transfer up to $30M+ (indexed) without estate tax.

## Key Benefits

- Preserves deceased spouse's unused exemption
- No trust required (unlike credit shelter trusts)
- Simple election on Form 706
- Indexed for inflation (DSUE from year of death)
- Surviving spouse can use for gifts during life or at death
- Flexibility—surviving spouse not locked into specific plan
- Late election available up to 5 years after death

## How Portability Works

### DSUE Amount Calculation

**Formula:**
```
DSUE = Deceased Spouse's Basic Exclusion Amount - (Taxable Estate + Adjusted Taxable Gifts)
```

**Example (2025 Death):**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Basic Exclusion Amount (2025) | $13,990,000 |
| Less: Taxable Estate | ($5,000,000) |
| Less: Adjusted Taxable Gifts | ($1,000,000) |
| **DSUE Available** | **$7,990,000** |

### Portability vs. Credit Shelter Trust

| Feature | Portability | Credit Shelter Trust |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| Filing requirement | Form 706 required | Trust funding required |
| GST exemption preserved | **No** | Yes |
| Asset protection | No | Yes |
| Growth protected | No (fixed amount) | Yes (appreciation excluded) |
| State estate tax | May not apply | Usually applies |
| Complexity | Lower | Higher |
| Cost | $5,000-$15,000 (706) | $10,000+ setup plus ongoing |
| Flexibility for survivor | High | Lower |

## Requirements

### Form 706 Filing Requirements

**Must File Form 706:**
- Within 9 months of death (plus 6-month extension)
- Complete return (not just portability election)
- All required schedules
- Asset valuations
- Executor signature

**Even if:**
- No estate tax due
- Estate well below exemption
- Simple estate

### Late Portability Elections

**Rev. Proc. 2022-32 (Simplified Method):**
- Estate qualifies if under filing threshold
- No estate tax return previously filed
- File within **5 years** of date of death
- Include statement on top of Form 706
- No user fee required

**Requirements:**
1. Decedent was U.S. citizen or resident
2. Estate not required to file (under threshold)
3. No Form 706 previously filed
4. Filed on or before 5th anniversary of death

### Who Can Use DSUE

**Surviving Spouse Only:**
- Must be legal spouse at death
- Can use for lifetime gifts
- Can use at own death
- Cannot transfer to others
- Lost if surviving spouse remarries and new spouse dies

### Last Deceased Spouse Rule

**Critical Limitation:**
- Only DSUE from **last** deceased spouse available
- Remarriage can cause loss of DSUE
- Use it or lose it scenario

**Example:**
```
Spouse 1 dies → DSUE of $5M available
Surviving spouse remarries
Spouse 2 dies → DSUE of $2M available
Original $5M DSUE is LOST
```

**Planning:** Use DSUE for lifetime gifts before remarriage

## Client Fit Criteria

### Ideal Candidates for Portability Election

| Characteristic | Why Important |
|----------------|---------------|
| Married couples | Required for portability |
| First spouse death with unused exemption | DSUE available |
| Estate potentially taxable at second death | Need additional exemption |
| No GST planning needed | Portability doesn't cover GST |
| Simpler planning preferred | Alternative to credit shelter trust |
| Surviving spouse needs flexibility | No locked assets |

### Post-OBBBA Planning Priorities

| Situation | Priority |
|-----------|----------|
| Recent death (within 5 years) with no 706 filed | **CRITICAL** - file immediately |
| Estates over $15M (above single exemption) | High - portability essential |
| Estates $10M-$15M per spouse | Moderate - preserve full exemption |
| High-growth estates | High - preserve DSUE before appreciation |

### When Credit Shelter Trust May Be Better

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| GST planning needed | Credit Shelter Trust |
| Asset protection important | Credit Shelter Trust |
| Appreciating assets | Credit Shelter Trust |
| State estate tax concerns | Often Credit Shelter Trust |
| Remarriage likely | Use DSUE early OR trust |
| Both spouses healthy, high assets | Consider both |

## Implementation Steps

## Case Study

### Scenario

Thomas dies in January 2026:
- Married to Martha for 40 years
- Thomas's estate: $8,000,000
- Martha's assets: $14,000,000
- Combined: $22,000,000
- Two children (no GST planning needed)

### 2026 Analysis (Post-OBBBA)

**Basic Exclusion (2026):** $15,000,000 per person (permanent)

**Without Portability Election:**
- Martha's exemption at death: $15,000,000
- Martha's estate (assuming no change): $22,000,000
- Taxable estate: $7,000,000
- Estate tax: **$2,800,000**

**With Portability Election:**

**Thomas's Estate (2026):**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Gross Estate | $8,000,000 |
| Basic Exclusion | $15,000,000 |
| Taxable Estate | $0 |
| Estate Tax | $0 |
| **DSUE Created** | **$7,000,000** |

**Martha's Estate (Later Death):**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Gross Estate | $22,000,000 |
| Own Exemption | $15,000,000 |
| Plus DSUE | $7,000,000 |
| Total Exemption | $22,000,000 |
| Taxable Estate | $0 |
| Estate Tax | **$0** |

**Tax Savings from Portability: $2,800,000**

### Filing Cost Analysis

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Form 706 preparation (simple estate) | $8,000 |
| Estate tax savings | $2,800,000 |
| **ROI** | **34,900%** |

## Portability Planning Strategies

### Strategy 1: Always File Form 706

**Rule of Thumb:**
- File for ANY married decedent with assets
- Cost is minimal compared to potential benefit
- Cannot predict future estate values
- Cannot predict future exemption amounts

### Strategy 2: Use DSUE Before Remarriage

**If surviving spouse may remarry:**
1. Make lifetime gifts using DSUE
2. Use DSUE before own exemption
3. Document gifts properly
4. Preserve DSUE benefit

**Example:**
- DSUE: $5,000,000
- Gift to children: $5,000,000
- DSUE used: $5,000,000
- Now protected regardless of remarriage

### Strategy 3: Combine with Credit Shelter Trust

**Hybrid Approach:**
- Fund credit shelter trust for GST planning
- Elect portability for remaining exemption
- Provides flexibility AND GST protection

**Example:**
- First spouse exemption: $15,000,000
- Credit shelter trust: $8,000,000 (GST exempt)
- Marital deduction: Balance of estate
- DSUE elected: $7,000,000

### Strategy 4: Consider State Estate Taxes

**In states with estate tax:**
- State exemptions often lower
- Credit shelter trust may save state tax
- Portability may not apply at state level
- Analyze both federal and state impact

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Not filing Form 706 | DSUE lost forever | Always file for married decedents |
| Filing after deadline | DSUE may be lost | File within 9 months or use extension |
| Incomplete Form 706 | Election invalid | Complete all schedules |
| Not planning for remarriage | DSUE lost | Use DSUE before remarriage |
| Assuming state portability | May not exist | Check state law |
| Ignoring GST | No portability for GST | Use trusts for GST planning |

## Portability vs. Bypass Trust Decision Matrix

| Factor | Favor Portability | Favor Bypass Trust |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Estate size | Smaller | Larger |
| Asset appreciation expected | Lower | Higher |
| GST planning | Not needed | Needed |
| Asset protection | Not important | Important |
| State estate tax | Not applicable | Applicable |
| Surviving spouse needs | Maximum flexibility | Can sacrifice some |
| Cost sensitivity | Higher | Lower |
| Complexity tolerance | Lower | Higher |
