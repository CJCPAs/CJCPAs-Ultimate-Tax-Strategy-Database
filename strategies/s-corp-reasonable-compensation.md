# S-Corporation Reasonable Compensation

## Overview

S-Corporation shareholder-employees must receive "reasonable compensation" for services rendered to the corporation before taking distributions. This is one of the most frequently audited areas for S-Corps because shareholders are incentivized to minimize salary (subject to payroll taxes) and maximize distributions (not subject to payroll taxes). Understanding what constitutes reasonable compensation and documenting it properly is essential for every S-Corp owner.

## Effective Dates & Key Law Changes

| Provision | 2024-2025 | 2026 and Beyond |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Social Security Wage Base | $168,600 (2024) / $176,100 (2025) | Indexed for inflation |
| Social Security Tax Rate | 12.4% (6.2% each) | Same |
| Medicare Tax Rate | 2.9% (1.45% each) | Same |
| Additional Medicare Tax | 0.9% over $200K/$250K | Same |
| Section 199A QBI Deduction | 20% of QBI | **Expires** (unless extended) |
| Net Investment Income Tax | 3.8% | Same |

**2026 Planning Alert:** When Section 199A expires, the calculus changes significantly. Currently, minimizing salary maximizes QBI. After 2026, reasonable compensation analysis focuses purely on payroll tax savings.

### Tax Savings from Low Salary (Current Risk)

**Example: $300,000 S-Corp Net Income**

| Scenario | Salary | Distribution | Payroll Tax | Income Tax | Total Tax |
|----------|--------|--------------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| All Salary | $300,000 | $0 | $34,062 | $67,206 | $101,268 |
| Reasonable ($150K) | $150,000 | $150,000 | $20,212 | $67,206 | $87,418 |
| Too Low ($50K) | $50,000 | $250,000 | $7,650 | $67,206 | $74,856 |

**"Savings" from too-low salary:** $26,412/year... but IRS audit risk!

## What is Reasonable Compensation?

### IRS Factors (Revenue Ruling 59-221)

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Training and experience** | Education, certifications, years in field |
| **Duties and responsibilities** | What does the shareholder actually do? |
| **Time devoted** | Hours worked per week/year |
| **Comparable salaries** | What do similar employees earn? |
| **Compensation agreements** | Formal employment agreements |
| **Dividend history** | Pattern of distributions vs. salary |
| **Compensation paid to non-shareholders** | What do other employees earn? |
| **Company size and complexity** | Revenue, employees, operations |

### Court-Established Factors

**From Elliotts, Inc. v. Commissioner and Watson v. Commissioner:**

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Employee qualifications | High |
| Nature and scope of work | High |
| Company size and complexity | Moderate |
| Economic conditions | Moderate |
| Comparable compensation | High |
| Salary policies | Moderate |
| Amount of shareholder distributions | Moderate |
| Compensation paid in prior years | Moderate |

### Safe Harbor Guidelines

**There is NO official safe harbor, but practitioners use:**

| Approach | Method |
|----------|--------|
| **60/40 Rule** | 60% salary, 40% distribution (rough guide) |
| **Industry Surveys** | BLS, Robert Half, industry associations |
| **1/3 Rule** | Salary ≥ 1/3 of net income (minimum) |
| **Comparable Analysis** | Document what similar employees earn |
| **Cost-Plus** | Base salary + percentage of profits |

## Requirements

### Who Must Take Reasonable Compensation?

**Any shareholder who:**
- Provides services to the S-Corp
- Receives distributions
- Has involvement in operations

**Cannot avoid by:**
- Taking only distributions
- Being "passive" while clearly working
- Using loan arrangements
- Having another "day job"

### Documentation Requirements

**Essential Documentation:**

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Written job description | Defines duties and responsibilities |
| Time records | Supports hours worked |
| Compensation study | Third-party analysis |
| Industry salary surveys | Comparable data |
| Board minutes | Documents compensation decisions |
| Employment agreement | Formalizes arrangement |

### Red Flags for IRS Audit

| Red Flag | Risk Level |
|----------|------------|
| Zero salary with distributions | Very High |
| Salary < $50,000 with large distributions | High |
| Salary unchanged for many years | Moderate |
| Salary inconsistent with industry | High |
| No documentation | Very High |
| Shareholder is only "employee" | Moderate |

## Client Fit Criteria

### S-Corp Compensation Analysis Needed

| Situation | Priority |
|-----------|----------|
| New S-Corp election | High - establish pattern |
| Significant profit increase | High - adjust salary |
| Adding shareholders | High - multiple people |
| IRS inquiry or audit | Critical - respond properly |
| Business sale planning | High - affects valuation |
| Annual review | Moderate - document annually |

### Factors Affecting Reasonable Compensation

| Factor | Higher Salary Indicator | Lower Salary Indicator |
|--------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Industry | Professional services | Passive investments |
| Time commitment | Full-time | Part-time |
| Role | CEO/active | Investor only |
| Experience | Extensive | Limited |
| Revenue | Higher | Lower |
| Other employees | None (owner does all) | Many (owner delegates) |

## Determining Reasonable Compensation

### Step 1: Document Duties and Time

**Create detailed job description:**
- All functions performed
- Hours per week
- Skills required
- Decision-making authority
- Revenue responsibility

### Step 2: Gather Comparable Data

**Sources:**
| Source | Usefulness |
|--------|------------|
| Bureau of Labor Statistics | Good baseline |
| Robert Half Salary Guide | Industry-specific |
| Glassdoor/Indeed | Market data |
| Industry associations | Specialized data |
| RCReports | Formal compensation studies |
| Salary.com | Detailed comparisons |

### Step 3: Adjust for Factors

**Adjustments from base comparable:**
| Factor | Adjustment |
|--------|------------|
| Geographic location | +/- 20% |
| Company size | +/- 15% |
| Experience level | +/- 25% |
| Industry specialization | +/- 20% |
| Performance/profits | +/- variable |

### Step 4: Document the Analysis

**Compensation Memo Contents:**
1. Shareholder name and role
2. Duties performed
3. Hours dedicated
4. Comparable salary data
5. Adjustments made
6. Final compensation determined
7. Date and signatures

## Tax Calculations

### Payroll Tax Analysis (2025)

**$200,000 Available for Compensation + Distribution:**

**Scenario 1: $100,000 Salary / $100,000 Distribution**
| Tax | Calculation | Amount |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| Social Security (employer) | $100,000 × 6.2% | $6,200 |
| Medicare (employer) | $100,000 × 1.45% | $1,450 |
| Social Security (employee) | $100,000 × 6.2% | $6,200 |
| Medicare (employee) | $100,000 × 1.45% | $1,450 |
| **Total Payroll Tax** | | **$15,300** |

**Scenario 2: $175,000 Salary / $25,000 Distribution**
| Tax | Calculation | Amount |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| Social Security (employer) | $168,600 × 6.2% | $10,453 |
| Medicare (employer) | $175,000 × 1.45% | $2,538 |
| Social Security (employee) | $168,600 × 6.2% | $10,453 |
| Medicare (employee) | $175,000 × 1.45% | $2,538 |
| **Total Payroll Tax** | | **$25,982** |

**Additional Payroll Tax:** $10,682

### Section 199A Interaction (Through 2025)

**QBI Deduction Impact:**

| Salary | QBI (simplified) | 199A Deduction (20%) |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| $100,000 | $100,000 | $20,000 |
| $150,000 | $50,000 | $10,000 |
| $200,000 | $0 | $0 |

**Optimal Balance:**
- Lower salary = Higher QBI = Larger 199A deduction
- Must balance against reasonable compensation requirement

### Complete Example (2025)

**Consulting S-Corp:**
- Gross revenue: $500,000
- Expenses: $100,000
- Net before salary: $400,000
- Single shareholder

**Reasonable Compensation Determination:**
- Industry data: Consultants earn $150,000-$250,000
- Shareholder experience: 20 years
- Time: Full-time
- Comparable: $200,000

| Item | Conservative | Aggressive | Risk |
|------|--------------|------------|------|
| Salary | $200,000 | $120,000 | Higher |
| Distribution | $200,000 | $280,000 | Higher |
| Payroll tax | $27,144 | $18,360 | N/A |
| QBI | $200,000 | $280,000 | N/A |
| 199A deduction | $40,000 | $56,000 | N/A |
| 199A tax savings | $14,800 | $20,720 | N/A |
| **Net tax difference** | Baseline | ($2,936) | Audit risk |

## IRS Audit Defense

### Common IRS Arguments

| IRS Position | Defense |
|--------------|---------|
| Salary too low | Comparable analysis, documentation |
| Should be higher | Industry data, job description |
| Distributions are disguised wages | Consistent treatment, business purpose |
| Pattern suggests tax avoidance | Historical context, business changes |

### Documentation Strategy

**Before Audit:**
1. Annual compensation memo
2. Board resolution setting salary
3. Comparable salary studies
4. Job descriptions
5. Time records
6. Industry surveys

**During Audit:**
1. Provide documentation promptly
2. Explain methodology
3. Show comparables
4. Demonstrate reasonableness
5. Engage representation if needed

### Penalty Exposure

| Violation | Penalty |
|-----------|---------|
| Unpaid employment taxes | 100% Trust Fund Recovery |
| Accuracy-related | 20% of underpayment |
| Failure to file forms | Per form penalties |
| Fraud | 75% of underpayment |
| Interest | Compounded daily |

## Case Study

### Scenario

Dr. Smith, dentist:
- S-Corp dental practice
- Gross revenue: $800,000
- Net before salary: $450,000
- Only dentist (no associates)
- Full-time practice
- Taking $80,000 salary, $370,000 distributions

### IRS Audit Outcome (Watson v. Commissioner pattern)

**IRS Position:**
- Comparable dentists earn $200,000-$300,000
- Dr. Smith provides ALL services
- $80,000 is unreasonably low
- Reclassify $170,000 as wages

**Tax Consequences if Reclassified:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Additional wages | $170,000 |
| Employer FICA | $13,005 |
| Employee FICA | $13,005 |
| **Additional tax** | **$26,010** |
| Plus interest and penalties | ~$5,000+ |

### Proper Planning

**Reasonable Compensation Analysis:**
| Factor | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| Industry (dentists) | $180,000-$280,000 |
| Experience (15 years) | Above average |
| Location (suburban) | Average |
| Practice size | Above average |
| **Reasonable range** | **$220,000-$260,000** |

**Recommended Structure:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Salary | $240,000 |
| Distribution | $210,000 |
| Payroll tax | $30,486 |
| QBI | $210,000 |
| 199A deduction | $42,000 |
| 199A savings | $15,540 |
| **Net additional tax vs. audit scenario** | ~$15,000 but NO audit risk |

## Best Practices

### Annual Review Checklist

- [ ] Update job description
- [ ] Review comparable salary data
- [ ] Document time commitment
- [ ] Board resolution on compensation
- [ ] Memo supporting reasonableness
- [ ] Consistent with prior years (or explain changes)
- [ ] W-2 processing before distributions
- [ ] Quarterly payroll tax compliance

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Zero salary | Almost certain reclassification | Always pay some salary |
| Static salary for years | Doesn't reflect growth | Annual review |
| No documentation | Can't defend in audit | Document everything |
| 1099 instead of W-2 | Worker classification issue | Proper employment |
| Large year-end bonus | May look like distribution | Regular payments |
| Ignoring industry data | Can't support reasonableness | Use surveys |
