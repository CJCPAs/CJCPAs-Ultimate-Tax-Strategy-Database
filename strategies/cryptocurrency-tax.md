# Cryptocurrency Tax Planning

## Overview

Cryptocurrency is treated as property for U.S. federal tax purposes, meaning every sale, exchange, or use of crypto is a potentially taxable event. With the IRS significantly increasing enforcement and reporting requirements, understanding crypto tax rules is essential for anyone holding or transacting in digital assets. Proper planning can minimize tax liability while ensuring compliance.

## Effective Dates & Key Law Changes

## Key Concepts

### What is a Taxable Event?

| Event | Taxable? | Tax Type |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Buying crypto with USD | No | None |
| Selling crypto for USD | Yes | Capital gain/loss |
| Trading crypto for crypto | Yes | Capital gain/loss |
| Using crypto to buy goods/services | Yes | Capital gain/loss |
| Receiving payment in crypto | Yes | Ordinary income |
| Mining crypto | Yes | Ordinary income |
| Staking rewards | Yes | Ordinary income |
| Airdrops | Yes | Ordinary income |
| Hard forks (received new coin) | Yes | Ordinary income |
| Gifting crypto | Generally no | May use gift exclusion |
| Donating crypto | No gain | Deduction available |
| Transferring between own wallets | No | None |

### Capital Gains Treatment

| Holding Period | Tax Rate | Classification |
|----------------|----------|----------------|
| 1 year or less | Up to 37% | Short-term |
| More than 1 year | 0%/15%/20% | Long-term |

**Plus:** 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax if applicable

### Cost Basis Methods

| Method | Description | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Specific Identification** | Choose which lots to sell | Tax optimization |
| **FIFO** | First in, first out | Simple tracking |
| **LIFO** | Last in, first out | May minimize gain |
| **HIFO** | Highest in, first out | Minimize gain |
| **Average Cost** | Average of all purchases | Not generally allowed |

**Note:** IRS requires adequate identification for specific ID method

## Requirements

### Record Keeping (Critical)

**Must Track For Each Transaction:**
- Date acquired
- Cost basis (USD value at acquisition)
- Date sold/exchanged
- Proceeds (USD value at disposition)
- Fees (add to basis or reduce proceeds)
- Which specific units sold (if specific ID)

**Challenge:** Many exchanges don't provide complete records

### IRS Reporting

| Form | Purpose | Who Files |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Schedule D | Capital gains/losses summary | All with gains/losses |
| Form 8949 | Transaction details | All with sales |
| Schedule 1 | Crypto income question | All taxpayers |
| Schedule C | Mining as business | Miners |
| FBAR | Foreign exchange accounts | If >$10K foreign |
| Form 8938 | Foreign assets (FATCA) | If threshold met |

### Form 8949 Reporting

**Required Information:**
- Description of property (e.g., "2.5 BTC")
- Date acquired
- Date sold
- Proceeds
- Cost basis
- Gain or loss

**Box A/B/C Categories:**
- A: Short-term, reported on 1099-B
- B: Short-term, not reported on 1099-B
- C: Short-term, no 1099-B received
- D/E/F: Long-term equivalents

## Client Fit Criteria

### Who Needs Crypto Tax Planning?

| Situation | Priority |
|-----------|----------|
| Active trader (100+ transactions) | Critical |
| Large unrealized gains | High |
| Uses crypto for payments | High |
| Miners/stakers | High |
| HODLer with occasional sales | Moderate |
| Small holder, no sales | Low (still report) |
| DeFi user | Very High (complex) |

### Red Flags for IRS Attention

| Indicator | Risk Level |
|-----------|------------|
| Not reporting virtual currency question | High |
| Large Coinbase user (1099 issued) | Moderate |
| Major gains not reported | Very High |
| Foreign exchange use only | Moderate (FBAR) |
| Inconsistent reporting | High |

## Planning Strategies

### Strategy 1: Tax-Loss Harvesting (No Wash Sale... Yet)

**Crypto Advantage:**
- Wash sale rules don't currently apply
- Can sell at loss
- Immediately repurchase
- Harvest loss for deduction

**Example:**
| Action | Date | Price | Tax Effect |
|--------|------|-------|------------|
| Buy 1 BTC | Jan 1 | $50,000 | Basis established |
| Sell 1 BTC | Dec 15 | $35,000 | $15,000 loss |
| Buy 1 BTC | Dec 15 | $35,000 | New basis $35,000 |
| Net effect | | | $15,000 deduction + same position |

**Warning:** Proposed legislation may add wash sale rules—monitor for changes

### Strategy 2: Specific Identification (HIFO)

**Minimize gains by selling highest-cost lots:**

**Example Portfolio:**
| Lot | Date | Quantity | Cost | Per Unit |
|-----|------|----------|------|----------|
| 1 | Jan 2023 | 1 BTC | $20,000 | $20,000 |
| 2 | Jun 2023 | 1 BTC | $30,000 | $30,000 |
| 3 | Dec 2023 | 1 BTC | $40,000 | $40,000 |

**Sell 1 BTC at $45,000:**
| Method | Cost Basis | Gain |
|--------|------------|------|
| FIFO | $20,000 | $25,000 |
| LIFO | $40,000 | $5,000 |
| HIFO | $40,000 | $5,000 |
| Specific ID (Lot 3) | $40,000 | **$5,000** |

**Tax Savings:** $20,000 less gain × 23.8% = **$4,760 saved**

### Strategy 3: Long-Term Holding

**Hold more than 1 year for lower rates:**

| Income Level (Single) | Short-Term Rate | Long-Term Rate | Savings |
|-----------------------|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| Under $47,025 | Up to 22% | 0% | Up to 22% |
| $47,025-$518,900 | Up to 37% | 15% | Up to 22% |
| Over $518,900 | 37% | 20% | 17% |

**Strategy:** Time sales after 1-year holding period when possible

### Strategy 4: Charitable Donations

**Donate appreciated crypto:**

**Benefits:**
- Deduction for full FMV
- No capital gains tax
- Must hold >1 year for full benefit
- Donor-advised funds accept crypto

**Example:**
| Item | Cash Donation | Crypto Donation |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| Amount donated | $50,000 | $50,000 FMV |
| Cost basis | N/A | $10,000 |
| Capital gains avoided | $0 | $40,000 |
| Deduction | $50,000 | $50,000 |
| Tax savings (37%+23.8%) | $18,500 | $18,500 + $9,520 = **$28,020** |

### Strategy 5: Opportunity Zone Investment

**Defer crypto gains:**
1. Realize capital gain from crypto sale
2. Invest proceeds in Qualified Opportunity Fund within 180 days
3. Defer gain until 2026 (or earlier sale)
4. Hold QOF 10+ years for exclusion of appreciation

**See [Opportunity Zones](opportunity-zones.md) for details**

### Strategy 6: Gift to Lower-Bracket Family

**Shift gains to lower tax brackets:**

| Recipient | Tax Rate | Benefit |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Child over 18 | Their rate | If lower bracket |
| Parents | Their rate | If lower bracket |
| Kiddie tax applies | Parent's rate | No benefit |

**Annual Exclusion:** $18,000 (2024) / $19,000 (2025)

### Strategy 7: Mining/Staking Structure

**If significant activity:**
- Consider entity structure (LLC)
- Deduct business expenses
- Equipment depreciation
- Self-employment tax considerations
- Retirement plan contributions

**Income Classification:**
| Activity | Classification | SE Tax? |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| Hobby mining | Other income | No |
| Business mining | Self-employment | Yes |
| Staking (passive) | Other income | Likely no |
| Staking (active business) | Self-employment | Possibly |

## DeFi Tax Considerations

### Yield Farming/Liquidity Pools

**Tax Issues:**
- Adding liquidity = taxable exchange?
- LP token received = new asset
- Removing liquidity = taxable exchange?
- Impermanent loss = not deductible until realized

**Current Position (Uncertain):**
- IRS has not provided clear guidance
- Conservative: Treat as taxable events
- Track everything meticulously

### Wrapped Tokens

**Example:** BTC → WBTC

| Position | Tax Treatment |
|----------|---------------|
| Conservative | Taxable exchange |
| Aggressive | Like-kind (not supported) |
| Practical | Similar to exchange |

**Recommendation:** Treat as taxable until IRS clarifies

### NFTs

| Transaction | Tax Treatment |
|-------------|---------------|
| Mint NFT | No event (unless sold immediately) |
| Sell NFT | Capital gain (collectible rate if art?) |
| Buy NFT with crypto | Crypto sale + NFT purchase |
| Receive NFT as payment | Ordinary income |

**Collectibles Issue:** If NFT is art, may be taxed at 28% (vs. 20% max)

## Compliance & Reporting

### The Virtual Currency Question

**Form 1040 asks:**
"At any time during [year], did you receive, sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of any financial interest in any virtual currency?"

**Must Answer:**
- Criminal penalty for false statement
- Yes triggers further review
- Must report even if only received payment

### Software Solutions

**Recommended Tax Software:**
- CoinTracker
- Koinly
- TaxBit
- CryptoTrader.Tax
- ZenLedger

**Features Needed:**
- Multiple exchange import
- DeFi support
- Specific identification
- Form 8949 generation
- Audit trail

### IRS Enforcement

**Recent Actions:**
- John Doe summons to exchanges
- Operation Hidden Treasure
- Form 1099-DA requirements coming
- AI detection of unreported transactions

**Voluntary Disclosure:** Consider if prior years unreported

## Case Study

### Scenario

Sarah, active crypto trader in 2025:
- Salary: $150,000
- 150+ crypto transactions
- Mix of short and long-term
- Used various exchanges and DeFi

### Transaction Summary

| Category | Gains | Losses |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Short-term gains | $45,000 | |
| Short-term losses | | ($15,000) |
| Long-term gains | $80,000 | |
| Long-term losses | | ($5,000) |
| Mining income | $10,000 | |

### Tax Calculation

**Capital Gains:**
| Type | Amount | Rate | Tax |
|------|--------|------|-----|
| Net short-term | $30,000 | 32% | $9,600 |
| Net long-term | $75,000 | 15% + 3.8% | $14,100 |
| **Total capital gains tax** | | | **$23,700** |

**Mining Income:**
| Item | Amount | Rate | Tax |
|------|--------|------|-----|
| Mining income | $10,000 | 32% | $3,200 |
| SE tax (15.3%) | $10,000 | 15.3% | $1,530 |
| **Total mining tax** | | | **$4,730** |

**Total Crypto Tax:** $28,430

### Tax-Loss Harvesting Opportunity

**Before Year-End:**
- Identify positions with unrealized losses
- Sell to realize losses (can rebuy immediately)
- Offset short-term gains first

**If harvest additional $30,000 short-term loss:**
- Net short-term: $0 (vs. $30,000)
- Saves: $30,000 × 32% = **$9,600**

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Not reporting | IRS notice, penalties | Report everything |
| Wrong basis method | Over/underpayment | Choose and be consistent |
| Ignoring staking/mining | Unreported income | Track all receipts |
| Lost records | Can't prove basis | Use tracking software |
| Treating like-kind | Incorrect | Crypto-to-crypto is taxable |
| Missing FBAR | $10,000+ penalties | Report foreign accounts |
| Ignoring DeFi | Unreported transactions | Track all protocols |
