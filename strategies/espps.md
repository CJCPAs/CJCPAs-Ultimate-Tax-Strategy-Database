# Employee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPPs)

## Overview

Employee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPPs) allow employees to purchase company stock at a discount, typically 10-15% below market price. Qualified ESPPs under IRC Section 423 offer favorable tax treatment, making them one of the best low-risk investment opportunities available to employees. With potential returns of 15-50%+ on a risk-adjusted basis, ESPPs should almost always be maximized when available.

## Key Benefits

- Purchase stock at 5-15% discount (typically 15%)
- Look-back provision can double effective discount
- Payroll deduction makes saving automatic
- Favorable tax treatment on qualifying dispositions
- Low risk relative to potential return
- No cost to participate (beyond opportunity cost)
- Immediate gain on purchase date

## How ESPPs Work

### Basic Structure

│  With Look-back: Purchase at $85 ($100 × 85%)                          │
│  Immediate gain: $150 - $85 = $65 (76.5% return!)                      │
│                                                                          │

```

### Look-Back Provision

**Without Look-back:**
- Purchase price = Current FMV × (1 - discount)
- Example: $120 × 85% = $102

**With Look-back:**
- Purchase price = LOWER of (Offering FMV, Purchase FMV) × (1 - discount)
- Example: Lower of ($100, $120) = $100 × 85% = $85
- Creates potential for much higher returns

### Typical ESPP Terms

| Feature | Common Terms |
|---------|--------------|
| Discount | 15% (max under Section 423) |
| Offering period | 6-24 months |
| Purchase periods | Quarterly or semi-annually |
| Contribution limit | $25,000/year (at FMV) |
| Payroll deduction | 1-15% of compensation |
| Look-back | Yes (most plans) |

## Tax Treatment

### Qualifying vs. Disqualifying Dispositions

| Disposition Type | Requirements | Tax Treatment |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------|
| Qualifying | Hold 2+ years from offering AND 1+ year from purchase | Favorable |
| Disqualifying | Fail either holding period | Less favorable |

### Qualifying Disposition Tax Treatment

**Ordinary Income Component:**
- Lesser of:
  - Actual gain, OR
  - Offering date discount (typically 15% of offering price)

**Capital Gain Component:**
- Remaining gain (if any)
- Long-term capital gain (held over 1 year)

**Example (Qualifying):**
- Offering price: $100
- Purchase price: $85 (15% discount)
- Sale price: $150
- Ordinary income: Lesser of ($65 gain, $15 discount) = $15
- LTCG: $150 - $100 = $50
- Total gain: $65, taxed as $15 ordinary + $50 LTCG

### Disqualifying Disposition Tax Treatment

**Ordinary Income Component:**
- FMV at purchase minus purchase price
- The actual discount received

**Capital Gain/Loss:**
- Sale price minus FMV at purchase
- Short-term or long-term depending on holding period

**Example (Disqualifying):**
- Offering price: $100
- FMV at purchase: $120
- Purchase price: $85
- Sale price: $150
- Ordinary income: $120 - $85 = $35 (the discount)
- Capital gain: $150 - $120 = $30

### Tax Comparison Summary

| Scenario | Qualifying | Disqualifying |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| Ordinary income | $15 | $35 |
| Capital gain | $50 (LTCG) | $30 (STCG if immediate) |
| Total tax (37% + 23.8%) | $17.45 | $20.09 |

## Requirements

### Section 423 Plan Requirements

**Employee Eligibility:**
- Cannot own 5%+ of company stock
- Usually 2+ years of service or less
- Must be employee (not contractor)

**Plan Limits:**
- Maximum $25,000/year of stock (at offering FMV)
- Maximum 15% discount
- Offering period max 27 months
- Equal rights for all participants

**Company Requirements:**
- Shareholder approval
- Written plan document
- Nondiscrimination rules

## Client Fit Criteria

### Who Should Participate?

**Almost Everyone with Access:**
- The discount provides immediate, near-guaranteed return
- Even if stock declines, discount provides cushion
- Mathematically favorable in almost all scenarios

### Optimal Participation Strategy

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Can afford max contribution | Contribute maximum (typically 15% of pay) |
| Cash-constrained | Contribute what you can afford |
| Risk-averse | Participate, sell immediately |
| Bullish on company | Participate, hold for qualifying disposition |
| Already concentrated | Participate, sell immediately to diversify |

### Who Might Limit Participation?
- Extreme liquidity needs
- Already heavily concentrated in employer stock
- Company in financial distress
- Need every dollar of current paycheck

## Implementation Strategies

### Strategy 1: Max Contribution, Sell Immediately

**Approach:**
- Contribute maximum allowed
- Sell shares immediately upon purchase
- Repeat every purchase period

**Benefits:**
- Guaranteed 15%+ return (annualized can be 30-100%+)
- No market risk after purchase
- Immediate diversification
- Frees cash for other investments

**Tax Consequence:**
- Disqualifying disposition
- All discount taxed as ordinary income
- Simple, predictable tax outcome

**Return Calculation (6-month purchase period):**
```
Contribution period: 6 months
Discount: 15%
Effective return: 15%/6 months = ~30% annualized
With look-back in rising market: Can be much higher
```

### Strategy 2: Hold for Qualifying Disposition

**Approach:**
- Purchase shares through ESPP
- Hold 2+ years from offering, 1+ year from purchase
- Sell after meeting holding period

**Benefits:**
- Potential LTCG treatment on most of gain
- Tax savings on discount portion
- Participate in further appreciation

**Risks:**
- Stock may decline during holding period
- Concentration risk
- Opportunity cost

**When This Makes Sense:**
- Strong conviction in stock appreciation
- Already diversified elsewhere
- Lower ordinary income tax bracket
- Long holding period acceptable

### Strategy 3: Timing Optimization

**Same-Day vs. Next-Day Sale:**
- Same-day: Most brokers can execute immediately
- Price fluctuation risk minimal
- Simplifies tracking and taxes

**Wash Sale Considerations:**
- If selling at a loss, watch for wash sales
- Future ESPP purchases within 30 days trigger wash sale
- Can defer loss recognition

### Strategy 4: Tax Bracket Management

**High-Income Year:**
- Consider selling in lower-income year
- Qualifying disposition reduces ordinary income
- But concentration risk during holding period

**Example:**
| Sale Year | Salary | ESPP Ordinary Income | Marginal Rate |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| 2024 (high) | $400,000 | $35,000 | 35% |
| 2025 (low—sabbatical) | $100,000 | $35,000 | 24% |
| Savings | | | $3,850 |

## Return Analysis

### Minimum Return (Stock Flat)

**Assumptions:**
- 6-month purchase period
- 15% discount
- No look-back benefit
- Stock price unchanged

**Return:**
- Buy at 85% of FMV
- Sell at 100% of FMV
- Return: 17.6% in 6 months
- Annualized: ~38.5%

### Maximum Return Scenario (Stock Doubles)

**Assumptions:**
- 24-month offering, 6-month purchase periods
- 15% discount with look-back
- Stock doubles from $100 to $200

**Return:**
- Purchase price: $100 × 85% = $85
- Immediate value: $200
- Return: 135% in 6 months
- Annualized: Extremely high

### Break-Even Analysis

**How much can stock fall before losing money?**

| Discount | Stock Decline to Break-Even |
|----------|----------------------------|
| 15% | -15% |
| 10% | -10% |
| 5% | -5% |

Stock must fall MORE than the discount for a loss.

## Risks & Considerations

### Market Risk
- Stock can decline after purchase
- Holding period for qualifying disposition adds risk
- Mitigation: Sell immediately after purchase

### Concentration Risk
- ESPP adds to employer stock exposure
- Combined with options, RSUs = significant concentration
- Mitigation: Systematic selling and diversification

### Liquidity Risk
- Payroll deductions reduce take-home pay
- Need to budget for reduced cash flow
- Consider as forced savings

### Company Risk
- If company fails, stock worthless
- Also affects employment
- Double exposure to single company

### Tax Complexity
- Tracking holding periods
- Multiple purchase lots
- Basis calculations can be complex
- Keep careful records

## Case Study

### Scenario
Lisa participates in her company's ESPP with these terms:
- 15% discount
- 6-month offering with look-back
- Maximum contribution: 15% of pay
- Salary: $200,000

### Participation Analysis

**Annual Contribution:**
- 15% × $200,000 = $30,000 payroll deductions
- But limited to $25,000 of stock at offering FMV

**Scenario A: Stock Rises 20% During Offering**
- Offering price: $100
- Purchase date FMV: $120
- Purchase price: $100 × 85% = $85 (look-back to offering)
- Immediate gain: $120 - $85 = $35 per share (41.2% return)

**Scenario B: Stock Falls 10% During Offering**
- Offering price: $100
- Purchase date FMV: $90
- Purchase price: $90 × 85% = $76.50 (current price lower)
- Immediate gain: $90 - $76.50 = $13.50 per share (17.6% return)

### Annual Returns

| Scenario | Return per Period | Annualized |
|----------|-------------------|------------|
| Stock +20% | 41.2% | 97%+ |
| Stock flat | 17.6% | 38%+ |
| Stock -10% | 17.6% | 38%+ |
| Stock -15% | 0% | 0% |
| Stock -20% | -5.9% | -11.5% |

### Recommendation for Lisa
- Contribute maximum allowed
- Sell immediately each purchase period
- Reinvest proceeds in diversified portfolio
- Expected annual return: 30-40%+ on ESPP contribution
- Highly favorable risk/reward

## Record-Keeping Requirements

### Track for Each Purchase Lot

| Information | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| Offering date | Determine qualifying disposition period |
| Offering price | Calculate ordinary income for qualifying |
| Purchase date | Start of 1-year holding period |
| Purchase price | Your cost basis |
| FMV at purchase | For disqualifying disposition calculation |
| Number of shares | Total position |
| Sale date | Determine disposition type |
| Sale price | Calculate gain/loss |

### Common Mistakes
- Using wrong basis (usually overstating)
- Misidentifying disposition type
- Double-counting income (reported on W-2 AND sale)
- Missing holding period by days
