## Tax Considerations by Entity Type

### C Corporation Sale

**Asset Sale (Buyer Acquires Assets)**
- Corporation: Recognizes gain on asset sale (21%)
- Shareholders: Taxed again on liquidating distribution
- Buyer: Gets stepped-up basis
- Double taxation concern

### S Corporation/Partnership Sale

**Stock/Interest Sale**
- Seller: Capital gains (generally)

**Asset Sale**
