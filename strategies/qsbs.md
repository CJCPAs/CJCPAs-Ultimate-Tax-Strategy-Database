# Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) - Section 1202

## Overview

Section 1202 provides one of the most powerful tax benefits available: the exclusion of up to 100% of capital gains on the sale of Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS). For founders, early employees, and investors in qualifying C-corporations, this can mean completely tax-free gains of $10 million or more. Understanding QSBS requirements is essential for startup planning and exit strategies.

## Effective Dates & Key Law Changes

| Provision | Pre-2010 | 2010-Present | 2026 and Beyond |
|-----------|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Exclusion Percentage | 50-75% | **100%** | 100% (no sunset) |
| Maximum Exclusion | $10M or 10× basis | Same | Same |
| Holding Period | 5 years | 5 years | 5 years |
| AMT Preference | Yes | **No** (for 100%) | No |
| Eligible Businesses | Qualified trades | Same | Same |
| Gross Assets Test | $50M | $50M | $50M |

**Key Point:** The 100% exclusion is permanent—it was made permanent in 2015 and is not affected by TCJA sunset.

## Key Benefits

### Tax Savings Potential

| Gain Amount | Federal Tax Without QSBS | Tax With QSBS | Savings |
|-------------|------------------------|---------------|---------|
| $1,000,000 | $238,000 (23.8%) | $0 | $238,000 |
| $5,000,000 | $1,190,000 | $0 | $1,190,000 |
| $10,000,000 | $2,380,000 | $0 | $2,380,000 |
| $50,000,000 | $11,900,000 | $9,520,000* | $2,380,000 |

*$10M excluded, remaining $40M taxed at 23.8%

### Exclusion Limitations

**Per Issuer, Per Taxpayer:**
- Greater of $10,000,000, OR
- 10× adjusted basis of stock

**Example:**
| Basis | 10× Basis | $10M Limit | Available Exclusion |
|-------|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| $100,000 | $1,000,000 | $10,000,000 | $10,000,000 |
| $500,000 | $5,000,000 | $10,000,000 | $10,000,000 |
| $2,000,000 | $20,000,000 | $10,000,000 | $20,000,000 |
| $5,000,000 | $50,000,000 | $10,000,000 | $50,000,000 |

**Strategy:** Higher basis = higher potential exclusion

| Founders | Potentially $10M+ tax-free |
| Early employees (stock options) | $10M+ exclusion on exercise and hold |
| Angel investors | 100% exclusion on gains |
| VCs (through C-corp vehicle) | If structured properly |
| Acquirers (stock deal) | May receive QSBS in exchange |

### Ideal QSBS Candidates

| Characteristic | Why Favorable |
|----------------|---------------|
| Pre-revenue startup | Easy to meet $50M test |
| Technology company | Qualified business |
| Manufacturing business | Qualified business |
| C-Corporation | Required structure |
| Long time horizon | 5-year holding period |
| Exit likely >$10M | Maximum benefit |

### Who Should Avoid Relying on QSBS

| Situation | Concern |
|-----------|---------|
| Service business | May not be qualified |
| LLC/Partnership | Wrong entity type |
| Already over $50M | Cannot qualify |
| Need quick exit | 5-year holding |
| S-Corporation | Not eligible |

## Planning Strategies

### Strategy 1: C-Corp from Day One

**For founders expecting large exit:**
1. Form as C-Corporation initially
2. Issue founder stock at nominal value
3. Ensure qualified business
4. Monitor $50M gross assets
5. Hold 5+ years

**vs. Converting Later:**
- LLC conversion resets holding period
- May lose early-stage QSBS eligibility
- More complex planning

### Strategy 2: Maximize Basis (10× Rule)

**Higher basis = higher exclusion ceiling:**

| Approach | How It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| Pay for stock | Higher cost basis |
| Exercise options | Basis = exercise price |
| 83(b) election | Basis = FMV at grant |
| Contribute property | Basis = FMV of property |

**Example:**
- Founder can take 1M shares for $1,000 OR
- Purchase 1M shares for $100,000
- $100,000 basis = $1M exclusion ceiling under 10× rule
- BUT $10M limit typically controls anyway

### Strategy 3: Multiple Taxpayers

**Each taxpayer gets own exclusion:**

| Strategy | Total Exclusion |
|----------|-----------------|
| Founder only | $10M |
| Founder + Spouse (MFJ) | $10M (same) |
| Founder + Spouse (separate stock) | $20M (each owns) |
| Founder + Children (gifted) | $10M × number |
| Founder + Trusts | $10M per trust |

**Gift Strategy:**
1. Gift stock to family members/trusts
2. Each donee holds 5 years
3. Each gets $10M exclusion
4. Must be bona fide gifts

### Strategy 4: Section 1045 Rollover

**Defer and Restart 5-Year Clock:**

**Requirements:**
- Sell QSBS held 6+ months
- Purchase replacement QSBS within 60 days
- Replacement QSBS requirements met

**Benefit:**
- Defer gain from first sale
- Start new 5-year period on replacement
- Can chain multiple rollovers

**Example:**
```
Year 1: Invest $100K in Company A (QSBS)
Year 3: Sell Company A for $500K
        Gain: $400K
        Within 60 days: Invest $500K in Company B (QSBS)
Year 8: Sell Company B for $5M
        Original gain ($400K) + New gain = Excluded up to $10M
```

### Strategy 5: Stacking with Other Benefits

**Combine QSBS with:**

| Strategy | Additional Benefit |
|----------|-------------------|
| Opportunity Zone | If QOF invests in QSBS |
| Installment sale | Spread non-excluded gain |
| Charitable remainder trust | Complex, IRS scrutiny |
| ESOP | Different rules apply |

### Strategy 6: Pre-IPO/Exit Planning

**Before Crossing $50M:**
1. Issue all anticipated stock grants
2. Exercise outstanding options
3. Convert convertible notes
4. Complete Series A/B funding

**After $50M:**
- New issuances don't qualify
- Existing QSBS still valid if met requirements

## LLC to C-Corp Conversion

### Proper Conversion Method

**To Preserve QSBS:**
1. Form new C-Corporation
2. LLC contributes assets to C-Corp
3. LLC distributes C-Corp stock to members
4. Dissolve LLC

**Key:** Stock issued for property contribution = original issuance

### Potential Issues

| Issue | Risk | Mitigation |
|-------|------|------------|
| Service partners | May not be property | Structure carefully |
| Liabilities assumed | Affects basis | Plan transfer |
| $50M test | Contributed assets count | Time conversion |
| Holding period | Starts at conversion | Plan for 5 years |

## Tax Compliance

### Documentation Requirements

**Maintain Records Proving:**
- Corporation was C-Corp at issuance
- Gross assets ≤ $50M
- Active business requirement (80% test)
- Qualified trade or business
- Original issuance
- Holding period

### Reporting on Tax Return

**On Sale:**
- Report on Schedule D / Form 8949
- Calculate gain
- Report exclusion (Code Q)
- Attach statement if >$10M exclusion

### State Tax Considerations

**QSBS Treatment Varies by State:**

| State | QSBS Exclusion |
|-------|----------------|
| California | **No exclusion** |
| New York | Partial exclusion |
| Massachusetts | Full exclusion |
| Texas | No income tax |
| Florida | No income tax |
| New Jersey | No exclusion |
| Pennsylvania | Full exclusion |

**California:** Significant issue—plan around if possible

## Case Study

### Scenario: Tech Startup Founder

**Sarah, founder of TechCo (C-Corp):**
- Founded 2019
- Received 1M shares for $1,000 (founder stock)
- Company grew, raised Series A ($5M at $20M valuation)
- Company acquired 2026 for $100M
- Sarah's shares worth: $20M

### QSBS Analysis

**Qualification Check:**
| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| C-Corporation | ✓ (from founding) |
| Original issuance | ✓ (founder shares) |
| $50M test at issuance | ✓ ($0 at founding) |
| Qualified business | ✓ (software) |
| 80% active business | ✓ |
| 5-year holding | ✓ (2019-2026 = 7 years) |

### Tax Calculation

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Sale proceeds | $20,000,000 |
| Cost basis | $1,000 |
| Total gain | $19,999,000 |
| QSBS exclusion (greater of $10M or 10× basis) | $10,000,000 |
| Taxable gain | $9,999,000 |
| Federal tax (23.8%) | $2,379,762 |
| **California tax (13.3%)** | **$2,659,867** |
| **Total tax** | **~$5,039,629** |

**Without QSBS:**
- Federal: $20M × 23.8% = $4,760,000
- California: $20M × 13.3% = $2,660,000
- Total: $7,420,000

**QSBS Savings: ~$2,380,000** (federal portion)

### Enhanced Planning

**If Sarah had gifted shares to family:**
- Gift 500K shares to irrevocable trust for children (2020)
- Trust holds for 5 years
- Trust's exclusion: Additional $10M
- Combined family exclusion: $20M

**Result:**
- All $20M gain excluded federally
- California still taxes $20M
- Federal savings: Additional $2,380,000

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Starting as LLC | Must convert, lose early QSBS | Start as C-Corp |
| Not monitoring $50M | New stock doesn't qualify | Track gross assets |
| Selling before 5 years | No exclusion | Wait |
| Service business assumption | May not qualify | Verify qualification |
| Buying from shareholder | Not original issuance | Buy from company |
| California planning ignored | 13.3% state tax | Consider relocation |
| No documentation | Can't prove qualification | Keep records |
