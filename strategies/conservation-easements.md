# Conservation Easements

## Overview

Conservation easements allow landowners to donate development rights on qualifying property to a land trust or government agency, receiving a charitable deduction for the reduction in property value. While legitimate conservation serves important environmental purposes, this strategy has faced significant IRS scrutiny, particularly for syndicated conservation easement transactions.

## Key Benefits

- Charitable deduction for donated property rights
- Property remains in landowner's ownership
- Continued use for farming, ranching, recreation
- Estate tax reduction
- Property tax benefits in some states
- Environmental preservation legacy

## Types of Conservation Easements

### Traditional Easements
- Landowner donates easement on their own property
- Held long-term before donation
- Genuine conservation purpose
- Lower IRS audit risk

### Syndicated Conservation Easements
- Investors purchase land through partnership
- Easement donated shortly after purchase
- Deduction claimed significantly exceeds investment
- **HIGH IRS AUDIT RISK** - Listed Transaction (Notice 2017-10)

## Requirements

### Property Requirements (IRC §170(h))
- **Conservation Purpose**: Must serve one of four purposes:
  1. Preserve land for outdoor recreation or education
  2. Protect natural habitat
